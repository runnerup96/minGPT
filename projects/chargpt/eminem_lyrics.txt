Rap God Lyrics Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But Im only going to get this one chance Somethings wrong I can feel it Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot so call me Rap bot But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I half cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin and a killin off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables skill a holic This flippity dippity hippity hip hop You dont really wanna get into a pissin match With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad Its actually disastrously bad for the wack While Im masterfully constructing this masterpi ce Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz Pac N W A Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position To meet Run D M C induct them Into the motherfuckin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin Little gay lookin boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy Youre witnessin a mass occur Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say lookin boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy Ima work for everything I have never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face lookin boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloadin Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin But I got your mom deep throatin Im out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin To censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP when I Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK a revolver and a See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from though And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows You write normal Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad Singin to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was a special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too Ugh school flunky pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongue in cheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Ima sleep in the front seat Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a god KEmbed

give an ounce of a motherfuck About the ones that were here before you that made rap Lets recap way back MCs that Wreak havoc on tape decks ADATs where the G Raps and Kanes at We need Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back Cause half of these rappers have brain damage All the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap I dont hate trap and I dont wanna seem mad But in fact where the old me at

about ice and Jesus Christ man how many times is Someone gonna fuck on my bitch You wont ever see Em icy But as cold as I get on the M I C I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick Turn down for what I aint loud enough nah turn the Valium up Cause I dont know how Im gonna get your mouths to shut Now when it doesnt matter what caliber I spit at Ill bet a hundred thousand bucks Youll turn around and just be like Man how the fuck Sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks And now he wants to take it out on us But last week an ex fan mailed me a copy Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study Itll help me get back to myself and shell love me I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that Id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry Especially an effing Recovery clone of me So finger bang chicken wang MGK Igg Azae Lil Pump Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne I should aim at

Joyner If you aint Kendrick or Cole or Sean then youre a goner Im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonalds But if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival But yall are actin like I tried to serve you up a slider Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto tuned And you woulda bought it But sayin I no longer got it Cause you missed a line and never caught it Cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it Cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest With your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist And Im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless What Ill never be is flawless all Ill ever be is honest Even when Im gone theyre gonna say I brought it Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic With a bottle full of malt liquor But I couldnt bottle this shit any longer The fact that I know that Ima hit my bottom If I dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet I dont see why yall even started with me I get in beefs my enemies die I dont cease fire til at least all are deceased Im east side never be caught slippin Now you see why I dont sleep not even a wink I dont blink I dont doze off I dont even nod to the beats I dont even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze Aw man That BET cypher was weak it was garbage The Thing aint even orange oh my God thats a reach Shout to all my colorblind people Each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green Aquamarine or you think water is pink Dawg thats a date Looks like an olive to me Look theres an apple No its not its a peach So finger bang Pootie Tang Burger King Gucci Gang dookie dang Charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what I say Give me Donkey of the Day What a way for to get underway But Im gonna say everything that I wanna say Welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch Invite em in like a One A Day Im not done Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand was it even worth it Cause the way I see people turnings Makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose Im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just tryin to do the right thing but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined Cause Im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped But if I could go back Id at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent Sold the dream to that hes deserted But I think its workin These verses are makin him a wee bit nervous And hes too scurred to answer me with words Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least hes heard it Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet

Walk on Water Lyrics I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Why are expectations so high Is it the bar I set My arms I stretch but I can t reach A far cry from it or its in my grasp but as Soon as I grab squeeze I lose my grip like the flying trapeze Into the dark I plummet now the skys blackening I know the mark s high butter Flies rip apart my stomach Knowin that no matter what bars I come with Youre gonna harp gripe and Thats a hard Vicodin to swallow so I scrap these As pressure increases like khakis I feel the ice cracking because I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Its the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers disc set Always in search of the verse that I haven t spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect I ve garnered The rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless And it always feels like Im hittin the mark Til I go sit in the car listen and pick it apart Like This shit is garbage Gods given me all this still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me as a god this is retarded If only they knew its a facade and it s exhaustive And I try not to listen to nonsense But if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished Im not God sent Nas Rakim Pac B I G James Todd Smith And Im not Prince so I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Cause Im only human just like you Making my mistakes oh if you only knew I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do Cause Im terrified to let you down oh Its true Im a Rubiks a beautiful mess At times juvenile yes I goof and I jest A flawed human I guess But Im doin my best to not ruin your ex Pectations and meet em but first The Speedom verse now Big Sean Hes goin too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom There was a time I had the world by the balls eatin out my palm Every album song I was spazzin the fuck out on And now Im gettin clowned and frowned on But the only one whos looking down on Me that matters nows DeShaun Am I lucky to be around this long Begs the question though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home Is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And its time to wash out the blonde Sales decline the curtains drawn Theyre closin the set Im still pokin my head from out behind And everyone who has doubt remind Now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times Now let em tell ya the world no longer cares Or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight outta mind I might go outta mine Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin tightrope outta twine But when I do fall from these heights though Ill be fine I wont pout or cry or spiral down or whine But Ill decide if its my final bow this time around cause I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Cause Im only human just like you Ive been making my mistakes oh if you only knew I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do Cause Im terrified to let you down oh If I walked on water I would drown Cause Im just a man But as long as I got a mic Im godlike So me and you are not alike Bitch I wrote Stan Embed
Bad Guy LyricsPart Produced by S and M Phazes Its like Im in this dirt digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work All it takes is one song on the radio youre Right back on it reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt Spent a lot of time tryna soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well looks like I hit a growth spurt But Im coming for closure Dont suppose an explanation Im owed for The way that you turned your back on me just when I may have needed you most oh you thought it was over You could just close the Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine Well Ive never recovered But tonight I bet you that what youre Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges Mind saying Let it go fuck this Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive hide the shovel And then drive off in the sunset I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But its easier to justify Whats bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch To think it was you at one time I worshipped shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit Thought some time would pass and Id forget it Forget it You left our family in shambles And you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed May be gone but hes not forgotten And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that Ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya Youre wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through Feelings I harbor All this pent up resentment I hold on to Not once you call to ask me how Im doing Letters you dont respond to em Fuck it Im coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you The cause of my problems My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on ya Poof then Im gone voosh I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But its easier to justify Whats bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy Ive been drivin around your side of this town Like nine frickin hours and forty five minutes now Finally I found your new address park in your drive Feel like Ive been waitin on this moment all of my life And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and Im duckin on the side of your house See its sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment To come and see ya but I aint here for your empathy I dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy Its revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential I peeked Continue to peep still bent low then keep Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak All the way round to the back porch Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this You dont plan for intruders beforehand Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue Gag chloroform rag dag almost hack up a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans Ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk And heres your Bronco hat You can have that shit back cause they suck Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it Were in a car right now wait here comes my favorite lyric Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy Hows this for a publicity stunt This should be fun Last album now cause after this youll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell Bitch I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits time is quite near Hope we dont get stopped no license I fear That sirens I hear Guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea As cops appear in my drivers side mirror Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least New plan Stan Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car Well gotta go almost at the bridge Ha ha big bro its for you Slim this is for him And Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again Part Produced by StreetRunner I also represent Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend Im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in Im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope its hopeless Im the denial that youre hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again Backs to the wall Im stackin up all them odds Toilets clogged yeah cause Im talkin a lot of shit but Im backin it all up But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished I am your lack of a conscience Im the ringing in your ears Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal cords after your concerts Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged Grab for some water But Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow Im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya Every woman you insult batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona Is half a facade and Matthew and Stans just symbolic Of you not knowin what you had til its gone Cause after all the glitz and the glam No more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them Im the hindsight to say I told you so Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow If you dont stop after they call ya Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip The baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions If theres anything you have left to say Less it makes an impact then dont bother So fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop So one last time Im back Fore it fades into black and its all over Behold the final chapter in a saga Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started It all tragic portrait of an artist Tortured trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts blacker and darker Than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers left off Embed

Beautiful Lyrics Lately Ive been hard to reach Ive been too long on my own Everybody has a private world where they can be alone Are you calling me Are you tryin to get through Are you reaching out for me Im reaching out for you Im just so fucking depressed I just cant seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises took my lumps Fell down then I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I dont know how or why or when I ended up in this position Im in Im starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt To vent but I just cant admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet And I know some shits so hard to swallow But I just cant sit back and wallow In my own sorrow but I know one fact Ill be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow Ill be one tough act to follow Here today gone tomorrow But youd have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes just to see What its like to be me Ill be you lets trade shoes Just to see what itd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each others minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each others eyes But dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so Dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so I think Im startin to lose my sense of humor Everythings so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room just as soon as I walk in its like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact Cause if I do that then it opens a door For conversation like I want that Im not lookin for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I dont need no fuckin man servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of em aint even funny like Ha Marshall youre so funny man You should be a comedian goddamn Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why dont you all sit down Listen to the tale Im about to tell Hell we dont gotta trade our shoes And you aint gotta walk no thousand miles In my shoes just to see What its like to be me Ill be you lets trade shoes Just to see what itd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each others minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each others eyes But dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so Dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands were dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip em dont expect no help Now I couldve either just sat On my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which Im placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in In every single place every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant actin stupid Aunt Edna always told me Keep making that face itll get stuck like that Meanwhile Im just standin there Holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen Stop sign pole at eight years old I learned my lesson then cause I wasnt Tryin to impress my friends no mo But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description Cause where you see it from where youre sittin Its probably a different I guess we would have to walk a Mile in each others shoes at least What size you wear I wear s Lets see if you can fit your feet In my shoes just to see What its like to be me Ill be you lets trade shoes Just to see what itd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each others minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each others eyes But dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so Dont let em say you aint beautiful oh They can all get fucked just stay true to you so Lately Ive been hard to reach Ive been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me Are you trying to get through Are you reaching out for me Im reaching out for you Yeah To my babies Stay strong Your Dadll be home soon And to the rest of the world God gave you shoes To fit you So put em on and wear em Be yourself man Be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Dont never let no one tell you You aint beautiful Embed

A piece of furniture egg beater thermos It may be disturbing what Im sayings cringeworthy But Im urinating on Fergie call Shady number Surely Im turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap State of emergency the planets having panic attacks Bradys returning matter of fact I may be deserving Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it Like a fuckin Terrier hid in it Despicable dumb it down ridiculous Tongue is foul shoot off at the fuckin mouth Like a missile a thunder cloud Hundred pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound And youll get a round like Digital Underground And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster With a lamp post door handle shutter A damn bolt cutter a sandal a can opener A candle rubber piano a flannel sucker Some hand soap butter a banjo and manhole cover Hand over the mouth and nose smother Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover The band the Lambo Hummer and Road Runner Go ham donut or go Rambo gut her make an example of her Thats for Sandra Bland ho and Philando Hannibal on the lam no wonder I am so stubborn Im anti cant no government handle a commando Your man dont want it Trumps a bitch Ill make his whole brand go under And tell Dre Im meeting him in L A White Bronco like Elway speeding Im bout to run over a chick Del Rey CD in Females stay beating em Bet you theyll lay bleeding and yell wait pleading But screaming is pointless like feeding Michelle helium Leaving em pale faced medium sized welt Straight treating em like a cellmate Seedy Im climbing hells gate Bitch Im like your problems

concrete gave and created a sinkhole Buried the stink ho in it then paid to have the street repaved Woke up in a dream state In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave Guess I eventually caved though cause shes layin next to me in bed directly aimin a gat at my head Woke up again and jumped up Like Fuck it Ive had it Im checkin into rehab I confess Im a static addict I guess thats why Im so clingy Every girl Ive ever had either says I got too much baggage Or Im too fuckin dramatic Man what the fuck is the matter Im just a fuckin romantic I fuckin love you you fuckin bitch Combative possessive in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events I said Hit the road then after she left I sent that bitch a text that said Be careful driving Dont read this and have an accident She glanced to look at it and wrecked Too bad thought we had a connect No sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case Than the model covered in LOr al and mace Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin While the whore was yellin Rape Til her vocal cords were swellin And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings face Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace Less youre Andrea Yates dont ask me for a date though Dont be late well the sentiments great But wait think theres been a mistake You wanted an intimate date I wanna intimidate I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly cause of the game of Wait dinner at eight I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly cause of the Game of love love love love La La La La La love Embed

Sing for the Moment Lyrics These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walkin around with his headphones blarin Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes A problem child and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin back Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants do rags and a stockin cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose his house is a broken home Theres no control he just lets his emotions go Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate Its like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin on corners and porches just rappin To havin a fortune no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously So Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense B Its all political if my music is literal And Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to Youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols And they wanna get one cause they think the shits cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves We entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales You ignoramus but music is reflection of self We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail Its fucked up aint it How we can come from practically nothin To bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted Thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pin up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes Thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe theyll admit it when were gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me its just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Embed

Guts Over Fear Lyrics Feels like a close its coming to Fuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called Hi My Name Is dropped Started thinking my name was Fault Cause any time things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent Of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog Gangster Nah courageous balls Had to change my style they said Im way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I went against it It was ingrained in me That I wouldnt amount to a shit stain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game I pondered I just wanna play my part Should I make waves or not So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I dont wanna seem ungrateful Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face Before you get made pissed off And keep plugging its your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion times How many times can I say the same thing Different ways that rhyme What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out out out Afraid Id never be found I didnt wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear Guts over fear For all the times I let you push me round I let you keep me down Guts over fear guts over fear Feels like a close its coming to Fuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know I know what it was like I was there once Single parents hate your appearance As you struggle to find your place in this world And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasnt til I put the pain in song Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark Started to spit harder shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone And the lights go out in that trailer park Oh And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song But Id rather make Not Afraid Than make another motherfucking We Made You ah Now I dont wanna seem indulgent When I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise pray to God I just open enough eyes later on And gave you the supplies and the tools To hopefully use thatll make you strong Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my dang self When on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you Ma cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium Least I made it out of that house And found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who alls they ever did Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted I represent him or her anyone similar You are the reason that I made this song And everything youre scared to say Dont be afraid to say no more From this day forward just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out out out Afraid Id never be found I didnt wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear Guts over fear For all the times I let you push me round I let you keep me down Guts over fear guts over fear KEmbed

after tonight Im grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet Cause thats what its like and attackin it like a Dracula bite Jetpack in a backpack when I write All this anger pent up inside I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter Figured Id try to set a big enough fire Thatll trigger the sprinkler system And Id escape but the getaway driver Screwed up my limo collided with the center divider I went through the window And ended up being pinned to the side Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guys wife Brenda The flight attendant from Idaho That took an antenna in the vagina hole Cause when I pick up a pen Im venomous And Im as slick as Dennis the Menace Like an evil dental hygienist sinister Youve been yellin dementedness I invented this Im the genesis Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist Fuckin smart alec degenerate I got Ellen DeGeneres Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy envious Of female independence hell with a clitoris hit or miss You will never consider this a bitter disappointment Ill never fail to deliver this Whatever the weather in thisll be Just like a certificate of authenticity that Im thinkin about Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way To make em picket I pick a day to be a prick Then Im pickin the wickedest shit to say Spit it back on a level incredible Head full of Red Bull unforgettable Better believe these beats are edible I consider loose leaf a vegetable And I stalk my prey You think you got away Uh uh not today Murder you on a song and then Ill just say I was with Dr Dre and Robert Blake eatin lobster steak And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake And Tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate Im a lot to take like Kanye walkin up on the stage For Beyonc like its my job to say That youre not a real artist but its my obligation Honest Abe is on his way you will not escape Ammunition replenished the Punisher With his gun insured hundred words In a clip other words motherfuckers better run If youre not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner No wonder no one dont wanna go And jump in front of a fuckin runaway locomotive Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the Speedom Speedom Speedom Speedom Speedom Speedom Speedom Speedom Sometimes I feel Like Ill never slow down Sometimes I feel Like Ill never slow down Im the fury the final fight I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin fright I flick it on fire finish him when the flow in flight Feminine fakers fall Im floggin a foe with a fife Never forget it I severed the head of a critic I sped up and did it you trippin to be a dead epidemic Or wet up a clinic and make a bloody redder percentage Of an addict whos havin to get the lead of a cynic I was never the Devil I put up a fight up in the industry Pedal to metal we givin the light a lot of energy We reppin beat checkin he that be Koba If hes the evil enemy itll be over Running you down in front of your town You ever makin fun of the

Believe Lyrics And I started from the bottom Like a snowman ground up Like round chuck and still put hands on you Stayin wound up is how I spend time Sucker free confidence high Such a breeze when I pen rhymes I just got that air about me like wind chimes Nother day in the life Used to have to scrape to get by Now my communitys gated and I Made it and my neighbors say hi Im givin em pounds Im upscale now Guess it means Im way in the sky But I still remember the days of Minimum wage for general labor Welfare recipient since a minor Look how government assistance has made ya Adversity if at first you dont succeed Put your temper to more use Cause bein brokes a poor excuse That should only give you more fuel Show em why youre you So close God its like I almost got it But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes So I Unabomb shit tick tick tick no remorse pew Screw it Im lit and that attitude I blew up on quick Thats why they call me firecracker I grew up on WIC wick wick wick with a short fuse I got some important news to report to Anyone who thought I was done nah bitch not quite Spotlights back on got my faith wheres yours Do you still believe in me Didnt I give everything I had to give you to make you see Ill never forget if you turn your back on me now And walk out I will never let you live it down Ill never quit do you still believe in me Man I know sometimes These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice To me theyre just ink blots I just fling em like slingshots and so precise So you might wanna think it over twice Or you retards can roll the dice But beef will at least cost you your career Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced But this middle fingers free as a bird Nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on Earth Too short for the verse studied his formula learned How to incorporate a curse Point it towards corporate America Stick a fork in and turn Cause four letter words are more better heard The world force fed a turd to me youre getting yours But sometimes I overdo it but I just get so into it I was there consolin you when no one knew it When your situation showed no improvement I was that door you walked over to it Im the light at the end of the tunnel So people are always lookin to me as theyre goin through it When that tunnel vision is unclear Shit becomes too much to bear Since Cleanin Out My Closet When I was havin trouble with the snare Im that unrealistic prayer answered And Ima get you jacked up like youre tryna fix a flat uh When you struggle with despair That double fisted bare knuckles coupled with this pair Of nuts Im cuppin I am your fuck it switch nothin can compare Do you still believe in me Didnt I give everything I had to give you to make you see Ill never forget if you turn your back on me now And walk out I will never let you live it down Ill never quit do you still believe in me Started from the bottom like a snowman Oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that But my batterys low Ima need a boost to my pack And I know that I always got Proof at my back I called you Proof because I knew for a fact My ace in the hole homie Im callin on you Cause I think Im slowly startin to lose faith in it so Give me that inkling and mo tivation to go Hussein with the flow Fake fans that are two faced didnt show Let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul Layin vocals two days in a row True statement hate to go down this road But theres only one route to cross this bridge So I walk in this bitch with loose change Cause all my dues paid but this booths takin its toll But its never too late to start a new beginnin That goes for you too so what the fuck you gon do Use the tools youre given Or youre gon use the cards youre dealt As an excuse for you to not do shit with em I used to play the loser victim Til I saw the way Proof was driven I found my vehicle and I havent ran out of gas yet And when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets Fanny packs hourglasses If time was on my side Id still have none to waste Man in my younger days That dream was so much fun to chase Its like Id run in place While this shit dangled in front of my face But how do you keep up the pace And the hunger pangs once youve won the race When that dual exhaust is coolin off Cause you dont got nothin left to prove at all Cause you done already hit em with the coup de gr ce Still you feel the need to go full tilt That Bruce Willis that Blue Steel that true skill When that wheels loose I wont lose will Do you still believe Embed

Evil Twin Lyrics Yeah Tryna figure out the difference But I think think the lines are starting to get blurred Im in a strange place I feel like Ma e when he gave up the game for his faith I feel like Im caged in these chains and restraints Grimmin every stranger in the place while I gaze into space Cause Im mentally rearrangin his face I need a change of pace Cause the pace Im workin ats dangerous Theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst I done quit chicken heads cold turkey And started slowly roastin em Cause thats where most of my anger is based Fuck your feelings I feel like I play for the Saints I just wanna hurt you aim for the skanks Then aim for all these fake Kanyes Jays Waynes and the Drakes Im frustrated cause aint no more NSync now Im all out of whack Im all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack Im goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is Im strapped for battle Suck a duck crawl out the back its a bar fight Prepare your arsenal And beware of bar stools flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also And I aint stoppin til the swear jars full You done called every woman a slut but youre forgetting Sarah Marshall Oh my bad slut And next time I show up to court Ill be naked and just wear a law suit Judge be like Thats sharp How much that motherfucker cost you smart ass Youre lucky I dont tear it off you And jump your bones you sexy motherfucker Youre so fuckin gravy Marshall I should start callin you au jus Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo Evil Twin take this beat now its all you I believe

keep up with my competition Hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius whos bored of his lines And that sort of defines where Im at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first then ignore the replies Theres darkness closing in there it goes again It controls my pen but that aint me its my evil twin But hes just a friend who pops up now and again So dont blame me blame him its my evil twin Welcome back to the land of the living my friend You have slept for quite some time So whos left Lady Gaga Mess with the Bieber Nah F with Christina I aint fuckin with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba My albums just sicker than strep with the fever Get the Chloraseptic Excedrin Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol s Feel like Im burnin to death but Im freezin Bedridden and

White America Lyrics America Ha ha ha We love you How many people are proud to be citizens Of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars For the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold or so were told I never wouldve dreamed in a million years Id see So many motherfuckin people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me So many lives I touched so much anger aimed In no particular direction just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days Who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair With some peroxide reachin for a t shirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me I aint causin nothin but problems And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government Im lovin it I shoveled shit all my life and now Im dumpin it on White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself If they were brown Shadyd lose Shady sits on the shelf But Shadys cute Shady knew Shadys dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby Look at my sales Lets do the math If I was black I wouldve sold half I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap so fuck school Im too cool to go back Give me the mic Show me where the fuckin studios at When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like Fuck it until I met Dre the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got Was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids Who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist Whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss Til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence Straight out the tube right into your livin rooms I came And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope Waitin to choke tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this like I dont like this note All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy Sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early Surely hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now Im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit Just look at me like Im your closest pal The poster child the motherfuckin spokesman now for White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America I am the Derringer Aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the galf and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy Fuck you Ms Cheney Fuck you Tipper Gore Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have Fuck you Ha ha ha Im just playin America You know I love you Embed
Untouchable Lyrics Hands up officer dont shoot Then pull your pants up promise you wont loot We may never understand each other its no use We aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through Black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you Black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you Pull up on the side of you Window rolled down profile Then we wonder why we see this side of you Probably comin from the dope house We could let you slide but your tail light is blew out We know youre hidin that Heidi Klum On you another drug charge homie its back inside for you And just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true Pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it In your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you Fucked up but what the fuck am I to do I keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin No matter how many lives you ruin Its for the red white and blue Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two No ones ever indicted you Why Cause youre a White boy white boy youre a rockstar My momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve White boy white boy youre untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar Black boy black boy we dont get your culture and We dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man Dont tell us your attitudes a result of that Balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at Why you kicking that soda can Pull your pants up we bout to roll up and Throw your ass in the van cuffed You dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are Our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands And put our minds more at ease Or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy Were fightin a crime war here come the swine Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities Thats what we call em pigsties for Theyre like eyesores to police Talk to you like just a piece of trash Feels like were stuck in a time warp to me As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions As this beat backspins its like were drifting back in To the sixties having black skin is risky Cause this keeps happening Throughout history African Americans have been treated like shit And I admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a White boy white boy youre a rockstar My momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve White boy white boy youre untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar Seems like the average lifespan of a white man Is more than twice than a black life span I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance Id rather hear em say Die N word than Die Antwoord Ninja now its better disguised banter But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially And cant find answers Were applying but McDonalds Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire So how can we have higher standards As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter We fight back with violence but acts like that are Black eyes on the movement Which makes black lives madder At cops and cops madder Thats why its at a stalemate And cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot Call the attack dogs off of us man You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop Sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods Who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns And know nobody black so they act afraid of us And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em A subconscious racist Wait why are there black neighborhoods Cause America segregated us designated us to an area Separated us Section Eightd us When we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us And education sucks and every days another Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz Why is it they treat us like dryer lint We just want a safe environment for our kids But cant escape the sirens Dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in The poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence And were trapped in these racial biases That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise Every time we see a devils face Lions tigers and bears oh my Its more like billy clubs and gats And we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black But you kill each other facts You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats Single mother strugglin through substance abuse While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes Fuck your Republican views Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black You better be strapped with a derringer Or be capped in America like Steve Rogers Cause no one oversees these cops and All we see is em beat charges We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings Just keep marchin til we reach congress But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance If you try to slander the flag but Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum If you dont stand for the national anthem We raise it you better praise it Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield Home of the brave is still racist ville So this whole nation feels like a plantation field In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals That had its Natives killed Got you singin this star spangled spiel To a piece of cloth that represents the Land of the Free that made people slaves to build Embed

Stepping Stone Lyrics Take me to the river Yeah yeah yeah yeah Its everything was totally new We were globally huge watchin sales go through the roof We wrote and we feuded Runyon Avenue soldiers included A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse We were so bulletproof wrote souped and soaked in our youth Thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe The death of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do And at the time I was goin through my own struggles too So I wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through Everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew I was hopin they do so I aint have to shoulder the crew The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew How to stand on their own and I dont wanna open up wounds I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died so did the group Shoot If I could leave this all behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Down to the river with you Help me leave this all behind Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones It was never the same and its bothered me since And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets The more time goes by the more life happens And we gotta be men we got responsibilities Plus we dont say how we feel And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in Been with you guys thick and thin But its almost as if sometimes were not even friends Which reminded me Biz Rockstar was the shit Yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit If youda put D on it wish I coulda did Porter tried talkin you into comin up off it I know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with Maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features But thats water under the bridge But Im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed If I could leave this all behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Down to the river with you Help me leave this all behind Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones Bacardi and Hen never thought the party would end One minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is startin to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch To tiny drops little drips And by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed You start thinkin of all the artists you dissed All the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get For turnin your fuckin back on Bizzy Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip subconsciously I honestly wished I aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment But its hard to pretend that yall aint got none I just wish I had words but I guess there just are none for this To my partners I cant say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you men But I just cant be the guy everybody depends On for entire careers cause thats not even fair I will always be here but that spark isnt there And I dont know how to recapture that time and that era Ive tried hearkening back to but Im fightin for air Im barely chartin myself Feels like Im on the descent but it was not my intent To treat yall like a stepping stone Though I aint left no one behind but we been down every road Done all we possibly can I know we kept our hopes up But the longer we spend livin this lie that we live The less is left for closure so lets let this go Its not goodbye to our friendship but D is over Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones Embed

Campaign Speech LyricsJumped out of the nd floor of a record store With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder In Ecuador with Edward Norton Witness the metamorphosis Of a legend growin like an expert swordsman From the Hessian war and Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan Endless source and reservoir Of extension cords in dresser drawers And deadbolts on the bedroom doors And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin Excellent boyfriend Use intercourse to settle scores With women who have vendettas towards men Dickhead is forced in til theres shredded foreskin Reddish torn and theyre only bein fed a portion Bed sores and sore shins Pregnant whores can get abortions Fetish for stickin metal forks in self absorption Skeletor I went to Hell and fell a floor A predator Im headed for competitors Better warn em what I lack in tact and a set of morals I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store Stegosaurus Chuck Norris with a thesaurus Yes of course a mess of warrants You want some Come and get some boys Im givin Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course On excessive force and pressure points And dressin George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange Dress and four inch heels to address the court With a bullseye on his back his whole chest and torso Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvons dad as a present for him In my present form Im Desert Storm Appetite for destruction theres no suppressant for Aggressive forceful and less remorseful in every morsel Unpleasant horrible hello gorgeous The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus Met a contortionist said When you wanna get sexual She said However I fit in your schedule Im flexible Expired tags on the Saturn got Catherine Bach In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on At a traffic stop gettin harassed sign an autograph For this asshole cops daughter Laugh cause I called her a brat on it He spat on it and brought it back lookin half in shock Had a heart attack and dropped dead Started fallin back with it And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock One ball and half a dick Apple Watch Crack front axle walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel Knocked over a fishermans tackle box and crash sound Asked if they had a laugh in stock That was fuckin stupid You got it twisted all cause I offered this bitch A doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic Bitch get to massagin this dick Like spas in this bitch slob on it with gobs of lipstick Got a shoppin list for you to run some odds and ends with Theres not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with Shes non existent Robin Thicke with a throbbin dick on some suave and slick shit But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin missile launches Misfit blond and nitwit Like Ive gone ballistic with a frostin tip kit Screamed I hate blondes and became one Im optimistic Love to start shit Shovin Clark Kents undergarments in the glove compartment Of the bucket bumpin Bubba Sparxxx Im double parkin up at Targets trouble causer a double crosser Shadiest mothafucka youll ever come across Olympic gymnast been known for some assaults A couple lawsuits enough to cause a stomach ulcer Same damn brain scan results as Rainmans is Somethings off but when Dustin Hoffmans Dressin up in your mummy costume On stage dancin to Brain Damage whats the problem Nothings wrong the name brand is back to reclaim status Run the faucet Ima dunk A bunch of Trump supporters underwater Snuck up on em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan Its a wrap like an ACE bandage Dont give a fuck persona to my last DNA strand E J in the waistband at the VMAs with the stagehand She wants kielbasa pre arrange an escape plan Three inch blade on point like a See and Say Consider me a dangerous man But you should be afraid of this dang candidate You say Trump dont kiss ass like a puppet Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin And thats what you wanted A fuckin loose cannon whos blunt with his hand on the button Who doesnt have to answer to no one great idea If I was president gettin off is The first order of business once I get in office Second thing thatll make me happys walkin up to Uncle Sam Naked laughin dick cupped in hand Screamin Fuck safe sex Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him Tell Congress I run this land And I want the rubber banned and make it snappy Addiction to friction and static Addict who cant escape the habit Continue to chase the dragon But as fate would have it I walked up in Major Magics Dressed as the maintenance man In a laser tag vest and a racin jacket With a gauge to blast it And sped away in the station wagon Stacey Dashs and Casey Anthonys Crazy asses in the backseat Throwin Stayfree pads at me Dead passenger in the passenger seat Unfasten the safety latches And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires Finna get a murder case and catch it Like you threw it at me encased in plastic And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skins peelin And skids til he hits a cement pillar Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder Knock it into the upper peninsula You wanna go against zilla The Rap God When will I quit Never been realer The in stiller of fear not even a scintilla of doubt Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller Revenge killer avenge syllable binge Fill a syringe til I Draw first blood Even pop shit on my pop shit and its popular Couldnt be more awkwarder Cause your innocence I robbed you of Its my fingers that got stuck up Taught ya ta not give a Slapstick hockey puck The broad hunter with the sawed off Like an arm when its lopped off of ya But Im not gonna get the shotgun Or Glock Ima opt for the ox Cause Im into objects that are sharp when I shop And its not a shock Im such an obnoxious fucker The Rock Hudson of rock cause who would have thought This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter That was for little slap on the wrist be warned Im unravelin quickly My squabbles Im grappling with your time traveling with me Try and follow as I wobble relapse into history with a flask of the whiskey Tip it back then Im twisting wine bottles Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column Thats the plan of attack when Im fixing my problems Wish my chest wasnt having to get these rhymes off em But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles And why I havent come back on these faggots who diss me is More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel But my patience is wearing thin Swear I been contemplatin rubbing shit in your face til I smear it in Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen And never appear again If you actually had fuckin careers to end But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer em in that direction and forget my ideas for them Molly Im gone off you Man light some kush Youre my first take Ill nail you Cant lie I gush If I won you over you would be the grand prize Im entranced by your looks come and give the Shady franchise a push You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch Jeans too small least three pant sizes tush Mushed against your damn side your puss And thighs are squished What kind of attires that Im ready to be rode Psychopath bet you well get it poppin like a flat Light the match to ignite the wrath Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me Like a scab Hard to describe in fact Startling violent perhaps Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that And you arent really surprised at that But as far as these lines I rap And these bars wouldnt dial it back if I star ed the track Why am I such a dick Embed

Role Model Lyrics Okay Im going to attempt to drown myself You can try this at home You can be just like me Mic check one two we recordin Im cancerous so when I diss you wouldnt wanna answer this If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus Ill strangle you to death then Ill choke you again And break your fuckin legs til your bones poke through your skin You beef with me Ima even the score equally Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally I get too blunted off of funny home grown Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono So if I said I never did drugs That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet My nerves hurt and lately Im on edge Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads Every girl I ever went out with has gone les Follow me and do exactly what the song says Smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people And drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal Im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal So Im dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill Some people only see that Im white ignorin skill Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill But I dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist How the fuck can I be white I dont even exist I get a clean shave bathe go to a rave Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave My middle finger wont go down how do I wave And this is how Im supposed to teach kids how to behave Now follow me and do exactly what you see Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me I slap women and eat shrooms then OD Now dont you want to grow up to be just like me Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole When we heard a knock at the door mustve been Ron Gold Jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold Killed them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco My mind wont work if my spine dont jerk I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt Im not a player just a ill rhyme sayer Thatll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer My rap styles warped Im runnin out the morgue With your dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn Im bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits A premature birth that was four minutes late Mother are you there I love you I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel Will someone please explain to my brain That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and Im in pain I take a breather and sigh either Im high or Im nuts Cause if you aint tiltin this room neither am I So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her Cause when I drop this solo shit its over with I bought Cages tape opened it and dubbed over it I came to the club drunk with a fake ID Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me Ive been with ten women who got HIV Now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me I got genital warts and it burns when I pee Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree You probably wanna grow up to be just like me Embed
Asshole Lyrics Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole that role I think I succeeded fulfillin But dont think I ever stopped To think that I was speakin to children Everything was happenin so fast It was like I blinked sold three million Then it all went blank all I remember is feelin ridiculous Cause I was gettin sick of this feelin Like Im always under attack man I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin Women dishin but really thinkin If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him Guess Im a little bit of a hypocrite when Im rippin shit But since when did this many people ever give a shit What I had to say Its just my opinion If it contradicts how Im livin put a dick in your rear end Thats why every time you mentioned a lyric I thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it Cause it gave me an enormous platform Im flattered you thought I was that important But you cant ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battled for it mad awards had GLAAD annoyed Atta boy they told me to slow down Id just zone out Good luck tryin to convince a blonde Its like tellin Gwen Stefani she sold out Cause I was tryna leave no doubt In anyones mind one day Id go down in history Think they know now because everybody knows Everybody knows That youre just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home everyone knows Everybody knows So dont pretend to be nice Theres no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows Thanks for the support asshole scratch Thanks for the support asshole Quit actin salty I was countin on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout Dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history well goddamn honky That compliments like backhandin a donkey Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Nah Im off him But what the fucks all this trash talkin about The fight was fixed Im back and you cant stop me You knocked me down I went down for the count I fell but the fans caught me and now Youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me To take my belt word to Pacquiao Momma said There aint nothin else to talk about Better go in that ring and knock em out Or you better not come out Its poetry in motion Like Freddie Roach when hes quotin Shakespeare So what if insults are revoltin Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think its a joke til youre bullet riddled But you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest And a Glock just to go watch Batman Who needs to test a testicles Not that man Half of you dont got the guts intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts And all those water bottles in Colorado so get lost Waldo My souls escapin through this asshole that is gapin A black hole and Im swallowin this track whole Better pack toilet paper but Im takin no crap ho Here I go down the Bat Pole And Im changin back into that old maniac In fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin Cause everybody knows Everybody knows That youre just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home everyone knows Everybody knows So dont pretend to be nice Theres no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows Holy mackerel Im the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinkin we had some magnetic pull Then screamed ICP in this bitch How do fuckin magnets work Cause youre attractive but we aint attractable Hate to be dramatical but Im not romantical Im makin up words so you can understandable its tragical Thinkin some magical shits gonna happen that aint practical You crackin a joke its laughable Cause me and loves like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault So its safe to say Im uncrackable My heart is truly guarded full body armor Bitch you just need a helmet Cause if you think youre special youre retarded Thinkin youre one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina Youre a train wreck I got a one track mind Shorty youre fine but you sort of remind me of a er Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor Been tryna hunt me down like a dog Cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent Cause all of my spare time is spent On my nose in this binder so dont bother tryin Only women that I love are my daughters But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget Im a father And I push it farther So Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line Its apparent I shouldnt have been a parent Ill never grow up so to hell with your parents And motherfuck father time It aint never gonna stop a pessimist Who transformed to an optimist in his prime So even if Im half dead Im half alive Poured my half empty glass in a cup Now my cup has runneth over And Im bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin coaster I m goin back to what got me here Yeah cocky and can t knock bein rude off so fear not my dear And dry up your teardrops Im here White Americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird If you stare at me and see yourself because youre one too Shouldnt be a shock because everybody knows Everybody knows That youre just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home everyone knows Everybody knows So dont pretend to be nice Theres no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows Embed
Wicked Ways Lyrics Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder Ever heard of Aspergers Its a rare condition Its what youre sufferin from when you simply dont care if its an degree day and theres no frickin air conditionin And you cant see the bitch s hair is frizzin Cause you got the windows up blarin the system In your Chevrolet Prizm The devil aint on a level same as him Picture someone who revels in straight masochism And imagine him givin an adjective an ass whoopin So bad they should put his ass in prison A word bully I verbally abuse verbs Like they did somethin to me personally Used to get bullied so Id cut class and ditch it Now I bully rap Im the shit faggot Cadillac from a K Car My ass from a hole in the ground still can t tell em a part Came straight out the trailer park Screamin Im proud to shop at K Mart and it became art And Im still fed up and as pissed off as they are To this day I still get in fights with the same broad At the same Walmart arguin over the same cart In the middle of the aisle whilin I dont give a fuck I dont play Bitch you think you saw this basket first Youre ass backwards like motherfuckin Bob and Silent Jay Illest shit you could think I would say Minds like a pile of clay Whens the last time that you saw a villain with a cape Ripped a gapin hole in it flipped out Ripped down the drapes tied em around my neck Went down the fire escape of the Empire State Slipped fell straight down to the ground Splattered all over the entire state And straight to hell got impaled by the gates Saw Satan stuck his face in an ashtray While I sashayed around flames with a match And I gave him the gas face And this aint got nothin to do with a scale Or being gay little faggot but by the way Thoughts are gettin darker by the day Im a combination of Skylar Grey Tyler the Creator and Violent J Its a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face Im insane every rhyme I say Sons you like an ultra violet ray I m sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat so come on and pile a plate I m throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise With the rhyme I m spittin while I m shittin on competition In the meantime it s always mean time Im gettin Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell I ve been a career asshole I don t see why these people always got my back I done said so much fucked up shit I was born a mistake but I was put here not by accident I had a purpose and that purpose Was to beat a beat purplish slaughter tracks I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit I m comin to get that quarter back Like Ndamukong the drama can build Your mama can ask me for my autograph Cause that cougars a MILF Shes the oldest trick in the book but I sure would fall for that You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight When I get on the mic Ima snap Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital When I overdosed woulda caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach acid Indigestion my suggestion s Kaopectate If it feels like Im runnin away with the game Its cause I am dont speculate spectate All I got is dick for days and insults for decades But I get by with my wicked ways Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches Cry til you get puffy eyes red faced But Im leavin on this jet plane You aint fly youre an airhead And Im sick of poundin a square peg in a round hole Sorry another catchphrase But your baggage aint gon fit in my storage overhead space Cause it just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods Other words dont try to put your heart in a headcase Cause baby stable mentally I aint I need my meds I peed my bed Im going blind I dont see my legs I keep on falling down No wonder you cant stand me I need my cane Someone help me I think my face is melting If you felt these migraines And see these maggots eat my brain This G I A N T hole in my empty head If you read my mind you can see my pain And youd see why I be this way Ever since I was knee high playin with G I Joes Told these hoes shut their P I E holes now peep my game Cause Im bout it bout it Like a fuckin echo Psycho on a cyclone cycle spiralin here I go Im outta control like no other mic go Stab you til the knife goes dull Im nothin but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes Cause Ima sock it to you Dyke ho you dont like it Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle And ride it like a motorbike Im finna blow the mic the whole night so Strike up the fuckin maestro Im nitro And hi ho hand me my shovel Im liable to dig my hole deeper And its off to H E double hockey sticks I go Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way

Caterpillar Lyrics You will not be able to stay home brotha You will not be able to plug in turn on and cop out You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials Because the revolution will not be televised This right here for the number one Number ones here with your number one You aint number one just another one Now everybody sayin that they number one Ring the alarm the caterpillar keeps firing Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin Im a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak If I didnt do this where in the fuck would you be at See theres a difference between us what I spit hit arenas You a drip from my penis I eat lions and sip hyenas You number one when it come to slaughtering mics Im tryna be number one in my son and daughter life Uhh all you niggas my little rapper babies Yall my children yall bit my shit and contracted rabies Dont you grade me next to these rappers baby thats degrading My style got so many different facets I switch into so many different passions Im skippin class to be fascinatin My pen is like Big Ben this shits just a classic waiting Your favorite rapper come at me I just decapitate him I hate congratulating these has beens who had their highs These rappers only won their matches because they strategize I bring Attica to these patterns and heres my battle cry Ring the alarm the caterpillar is firing Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin This right here for the number one Number ones here with your number one You aint number one just another one Now everybody sayin that they number one Kid think your number wont quit Number one song get your number one chick Number one fly with your number one kick When its all done then your number gon switch Hold up wait a minute Guess what Ima never do Show so much respect to you That I feel like were friends so now we no longer competitors That could be the death of you Never let someone whos not as smart as you Gas you up and tell you somethin you never knew Always stay professional you always gon make revenue Dont let people next to you that dont want the best for you Its completely normal to hold on to a regret or two I do what I wanna do they do what I let them do Everything these niggas be sayin is a fuckin lie Its nothing I can say to you that is realer Remember when you praisin the butterfly Dont you ever disrespect the fuckin caterpillar This right here for the number one Number ones here with your number one You aint number one just another one Now everybody sayin that they number one Kid think your number wont quit Number one song get your number one chick Number one fly with your number one kick When its all done then your number gon switch Youre looking at Attila the psychopathic killer the caterpillar Dont tell me when Im supposed to rap until Especially when your favorite rapper aint even half as ill A savage still the tracks a banana peel attack of the silverback gorilla Youre havin a little trouble fathomin this is actually happenin Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half And then had the shit hangin by a flap of skin After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again Pad to pen I m batty like eyelids when theyre blinkin a lot You copy me but youre not You cant be butterflies my offsprings are just moths I see that thing Ima squash it and rip the wings of it off So ring the alarm pull the extinguishers off of the wall Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah Till the shingles come off the roof well shout at the ceiling Slaughterhouse in the building middle fingers aloft Say what I think when I rhyme in ink pen I talk And the language I speak is my mind Kingpin and Penguin combined Spit like its King of the Dot A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart The frauds from the cream of the crop Hold up like a flashcard Damn dawg is that copyin or payin homage Its sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler My dad is your grandfather Ill have to re hatch on you Come back as a black wasp half yellow jacket you cant swat a Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it Smash it and stand on it dammit I cant stop it The rap is a vag and Im goin in like a tampon in this bitch Its a manslaughter Stampin out grasshoppers you cant be no Rap Gods In fact youre exact opposites you make a wack song And cant hold a candle but even Daniel san whacks off You jack offs need to come to grips like a hand job The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap Lumberjack with a hacksaw Number one but my pencils are number twos Cause thats all I dos with em poop is my pseudonym On the john like a prostitute when Im droppin a deuce And when Im producing them lyrical bowel movements These beats are like my saloons Cause these bars always got my stools in em And I dont need Metamucil to loosen em Bitch shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem Im bout to go spin another cocoon Then Im cuttin you from your mothers womb Then Im flushin you Embed
Offended Lyrics You claim if you get knocked by the cops Youll give em not even a statement Walk in the arraignment Shoot the bailiff karate kick the plaintiff Gotti with the stainless Ill just call it shoddy entertainment If yall was in the party gettin faded On molly had the audience sedated You wouldnt catch a body if it fainted Probably let it fall and hit the pavement But youd be the first lobbyin to claim it Bitch stop bein a lame Your hobby isn t robbery and dismemberin body limbs Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells And chainsawin them in the basement Hardly fits your job description aint nobody dippin Out the back of the club like Oh my God hes trippin Only time you get the blade is Probably with the dang lawn equipment aint it Wouldnt take a bobby pin and wave it I need to stop bein debated Youre still copyin Xeroxing Im still coppin a feel Like Bill Cosby at will poppin a pill Then spill Oxys in Jills coffee Then send her out to the hotel lobby A lil wobbly and still groggy This blond fucks reprehensible Misconducts never sensible Kiss my butt my set of principles Is gone but til I get the President to respond My pen and pencil is a missile launcher And Senator Mitch McConnell s Just as big of a bitch as Donald Shits on bruh Let me sing this shit soprano While I do it pizzicato Ivanka stiff arm her while Im hittin on Melania And this songs for all ya Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery Goin ham at candy yam On nanny cam Im gettin handies with the zanny Xannys In the Caddy armrest Im imaginin objects So Im battin cobwebs from a daddy longleg In Hamtramck Got the panoramic camera Xanax a banana hammock and a Santa hat Im smellin like a damn mechanic With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent Twice her age and Im actin half it Grow up Nah not that I know of yall Basement just got a frickin overhaul Got a stripper pole installed Started rollin all through those Klonopins Like a bowlin ball Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol And go through no withdrawal While I get fellatio and give a facial to An interracial blow up doll of Rachel Dolezal Youre so appalled Sos my manager Bitch I amateur fuck a pro career Coast is clear but nowhere to go from here And nobodys close so dont compare They aint nowhere near Im way over here My competition cant see me Cause I dont own a mirror But Marshall you are terrific So smart and gifted Im so narcissistic when I fart I sniff it Do a fake dab to smell my armpits whiff it Your anxietys throwin gang signs But I made strides with these rape lines Im cuttin back on women hate crimes Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes Bang bang bang bang time Dang knivesre butcher than gay wives Youre gonna need sutures the same size As the blade I push into caputcha When I pull em like sleigh rides Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times To make it on Dateline I came to stake my claim like a canine Waitin in a buffet line So Kellyanne Conway Im a really bad hombre Come play belly dance on me Ive been makin wedding plans all day Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds Eight year old with the wordplay Girl take this pole like a survey Today wasnt my birthday But Im caked up like a dessert tray So were in shape Cause youre in a slurrin state I m a you re an eight Like what I do before after and durin rape You wanna get into a pissin contest And find out whos better And be made a fool out of when I pull on em R Kelly with a full bladder Non high school grad Im not a scholar But Im so cold when Im droppin knowledge My degrees is the same as I got in college But nobodys hotter you owe me my respect I owe you nada like Haloti partner Blow me told you Im so dirty homie you can throw me In some holy water with some floaties on And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me While you hose me off and nope I wont be washed You hope to God I dont explode I gotta blow this spot up though I got a lotta mo I wont put the sugar coating on it though Cause sometimes you can feel like your energys expired Raps got you drained Dead tired zapped You feel like a wet pile of crap But look man like the feds buggin my phone I get why youre tapped But you gotta get your fire back Catch fire get upset and fire back Is what I tell myself When times get bad Cause sometimes I might get sad But I take the same advice I had And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie When lifes a drag Told her to do like her dad Dont cry get mad Cause little baby powders Belong in diaper bags Im hyper by the time you see this side of me Im right in your ass Foot up it I stood up for the kid Who had to put up with the bullies at his school You aint had to have no money Or go shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude Now my doughs amountin to a mountain Thats rised too high to count it Never asked to be rich all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted But then I think about it then Im enraged Cause I just figured out that if I was paid For the time I spent to put the pen to the page Itd be minimum wage But its embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but Im never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen and when Im dead I wonder Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible I guess I better go harder than ever cause Ill never get another motherfuckin opportunity again To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me They want me to go eat some worms And drag my name through the mud through the dirt But Ima make you eat your words You can try to hold me down but you better let me up Cause youre only gonna make things worse Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up Til everybody eats my turds Embed

Mile Lyrics Its alright its okay Im gonna make it anyway Gonna make it cant give up now Ima make it somehow Sometimes I just feel like quittin I still might Why do I put up this fight Why do I still write Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics And show these people what my level of skills like But Im still white sometimes I just hate life Somethin aint right hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like Da duh duh da da it aint my fault Great big eyeballs my insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just cant do it my whole manhoods Just been stripped I have just been victd So I must then get off the bus then split Man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this Mile Road Im a man Ima make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin Sorry Momma Im grown I must travel alone Aint gon follow no footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape from this Mile Road Im walkin these train tracks tryna regain back The spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant in the same pants Tryna chase rap gotta move ASAP And get a new plan Mommas got a new man Poor little baby sister she dont understand Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in the pad And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand While she colors her big brother and mother and dad Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet Its like I grew up but I aint grow me two nuts yet Dont gotta rep my step dont got enough pep The pressures too much man Im just tryna do whats best And I try sit alone and I cry Yo I wont tell no lie not a moment goes by That I dont pray to the sky please Im beggin you God Please dont let me be pigeonholed in no regular job Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are Yo Im tellin you dawg Im bailin this trailer tomorrow Tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye Say whenever you need me baby Im never too far But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know And Ima be back for you the second that I blow On everything I own Ill make it on my own Off to work I go back to this Mile Road Im a man gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin Sorry Momma Im grown I must travel alone Aint gon follow no footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape from this Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it Or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits Its different its a certain significance a certificate Of authenticity youd never even see But its everything to me its my credibility You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC Whos incredible or on the same pedestal as me But yet Im still unsigned havin a rough time Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline But when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go Who must I show to bust my flow Where must I go Who must I know Or am I just another crab in the bucket Cause I aint havin no luck with this little rabbits foot fuck it Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with I look like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit At the Salvation Army tryna salvage an outfit And its cold tryna travel this road Plus I feel like Im always stuck in this battlin mode My defenses are so up but one thing I dont want Is pity from no one this city is no fun There is no sun and its so dark Sometimes I feel like Im just bein pulled apart From each one of my limbs by each one of my friends Its enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin Sometimes I feel like a robot sometimes I just know not What Im doin I just blow my head is a stove top I just explode the kettle gets so hot Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I dont got But Ive learned its time for me to U turn Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned Aint no fallin no next time I meet a new girl I can no longer play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient all I need is the courage Like I already got the beat all I need is the words Got the urge suddenly its a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird Then I turn and cross over the median curb Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from Mile Road Im a man gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin Sorry Momma Im grown I must travel alone Aint gon follow no footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape from this Mile Road Embed

Leaving Heaven Lyrics Yeah Sometimes you gotta come back down Stoop to someones level Five dozen flies buzzin over your head Call me the Grim Reaper sleep is my cousin Youre dead to me now and Ima be the last face you see Fore you die cussin My eye a tigers and Im a survivor so I will rise up and Be triumphant cause when Im looking at my legacy Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it Like Triumph The Puppet so Im like Fuck it Pile the carnage up til its so high its touching the sky Let em all line up and attack Single filing up in the stack Call em toy soldiers Cause they just wind up on their backs Now the skys nothing but black But I am not coming back I done told ya I told the woke me to go to sleep But still they keep on provoking me Theyre hoping to see me completely broken emotionally But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke When these fuckers just keep poking me Now Im leaving Heaven Im leaving Heaven Angels wont find me Where I am going Ive been down kicked Like around six thousand times since I was a kid As a child picked on clowned been Countless times Ive been doubted Gotta remind myself of it every now and then So the route I wents self empowerment In a hole taught myself how to get out of it And balance it with talents wit Cause life is like a penny Cause its only one percent Who overcome the shit theyve underwent I went AWOL like what my back was up against Dont tell me bout struggle bitch I lived it I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked Malcolm Isaac and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle And I dont know if I would call that white privilege yeah But I get it how it feels to be judged by pigment Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks But I swore Id get them back Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking If I can believe in myself I could prolly achieve it Thats part of the reason I do all my talking with ink And as long as Im breathing I vow to outsmart em and beat em My God what a heart of a demon go at em and Ima get even Like Im in the Garden of Eden Im bout to go off of the deep end This evil is calling Im already seething and Im leaving Heaven Im leaving Heaven Angels wont find me Where I am going Okay so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat I was getting my ass beat twice a week Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep Flippin sofa cushions over just tryin to see If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece Twenty five cents eachd get us a bag of chips Wed be glad to get that even if we had to split Wed do backward flips looking back at it I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit Pop was a sack of shit yeah he died but I gave half a shit Yeah which brings me back to the dear ol dad that I zero had Since a year old forty seven year old scab Just to hear them words ear piercing Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring Should I feel upset You were dead to me fore you died Me Tear no shed Should I have made a mural at your funeral Had your coffin draped with a heros flag Where the fuck you were at When DeAngelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande Never met your grandkids fucking coward Only guts you had was from your stomach fat I couldnt see your ass goin to Heaven So Im asking for a pass to go to Hell So I can whip your fucking ass I hate that Ill never get to say I hate you to your face No coming back from where Im going Sky is dark my soul is black hand on the shovel Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal Vendetta to settle tell the Devil Im leaving Heaven Im leaving Heaven Angels wont find me Where I am going Im leaving Heaven Im leaving Heaven Angels wont find me Where I am going So you better you better run You better you better run You better you better run You better you better run Embed

I Will Lyrics And I dont think that I can stop it I do my best to try to block it Ive been sipping on like vodka Im blacking out you better watch it I thought I heard a voice in my head that said Kill I had no other choice that was left except fill My pencil full of poisonous lead the devil He wants me to murder this beat so I will He told me there are doubters who question my skill They wanna put my style to the test am I still The best They want the crown on my head I said Chill If you want me to murder this beat then I will Im a long way away from where you are in skill Foreign wheels my bitch wearin four inch heels She on the orange pill And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels Sacha Baron Cohen Ferrell where am I going with this Oh yeah I bar at will And when you throw the iron in it Im all that still The truth for real Im real true call that trill This is my house this place is mine Posted on any corner on any coast Im on You niggas need to leave that lean Henny and coke alone Terror to the business married to the strippers T Pain Student of the game pre Kane you niggas Post Malone Elite beatboxer minus the raps Rollin with at least three choppers Ryan is that I literally keep three shottas Im lyrically James Todd Tariq Trotter minus the cap I thought I heard a voice in my head that said Kill I had no other choice that was left except fill My pencil full of poisonous lead the devil He wants me to murder this beat so I will He told me there are doubters who question my skill They wanna put my style to the test am I still The best They want the crown on my head I said Chill If you want me to murder this beat then I will Manslaughter goons under the moonlight John Wilkes thats who Im in the booth like Ayy bruh I go ham for dead presidents And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us Knowing your Smith Wesson has never been clutched Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented Them niggas thatll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever I see you my niggas call me The Enemy Watcher The minute we spot ya the semill pop nigga we got ya Im livin to conquer remember the mantra Im grippin the launcher Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience Im still shockin like droppin a boombox in bathwater More shockin than a pissed off Blanka I just finished fuckin a fish called Wanda Im finna wander off into yonder Beyond just mentally stronger memory monster I remember the sponsorin thought that conquered his triple entendre You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber Quit horsin around in this building or you a goner Your Willy Wonka persona wont help you any longer Im Optimus I make prime examples of mini Tonkas Hogtie your squad and go bonkers Spin grab Denauns guitar and Honky Tonk ya All your bars subpar like good golfers I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it I thought I heard a voice in my head that said Kill I had no other choice that was left except fill My pencil full of poisonous lead the devil He wants me to murder this beat so I will He told me there are doubters who question my skill They wanna put my style to the test am I still The best They want the crown on my head I said Chill If you want me to murder this beat then I will Now this will probably be the most illest shit that Ive ever said God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head Cause I said Motherfuck school and instead went to special ed Sippin Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time That I startled my mom and had her scared to death Word to Method Man She heard some Wu Tang coming from towards the patio She was like What the heck was that She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled Protect your neck Now bow to the Lord hold up no better yet kneel Better yet get down on all fours and take a vow to always Rejoice in the sound of my voice but you dont have a choice Just a third of my will will overpower yours Using about a fourth to create the amount of force Itll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors Got a crown of thorns but it wont fit around the horns But Ima keep it a buck like a dollar store Im more than you bargained for and I am far more worse Than a forty some bar Lord Jamar verse Nothing means more than respect so when I curse You could say I swore to protect My image I have zero time or regard for A never was been claiming rap when its not yours If it was anyones house G Rap and Rakim would be havin you mop floors Run DMC would be havin you cleanin sinks Yeah your group was off the chain but you were the weakest link Rest of these youngins of mine Time to start throwing some shade this time Im shutting the blinds Cause when Im looking at yall shit its no wonder its why I need a visor cause yall are just sons in my eyes Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it Next door to an abortion clinic Newborn infants tortured and tormented With their foreheads dented when they drop cause the floors cemented Their corpses get ornamented The coroner with a storage bin rented To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin Distorted twisted this isnt no storybook ending This is only the beginning So Lord forgive me Im hearing voices I cant ignore them anymore theyre winning I thought I heard a voice in my head that said Kill I had no other choice that was left except fill My pencil full of poisonous lead the devil He wants me to murder this beat so I will He told me there are doubters who question my skill They wanna put my style to the test am I still The best They want the crown on my head I said Chill If you want me to murder this beat then I will And I dont think that I can stop it I do my best to try to block it Ive been sipping on like vodka Im blacking out you better watch it Embed

Arose Lyrics If I could rewind time like a tape Inside a boombox one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate Cut down on the Valium Ida heard everything But death is turning so definite wait They got me all hooked up to some machine I love you Bean didnt want you to know I was struggling Feels like Im underwater submerged like a submarine Just heard that nurse say my liver and kidneys arent functioning Been flirtatious with death skirt chasing I guess Its arrivederci same nurse just heard say theyre unplugging me And its your birthday Jade Im missing your birthday Baby girl Im sorry I fucking hate when you hurt Hai And sweeties thank you for waiting to open gifts But girls you can just open em Dad aint making it home for Christmas Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss I go to make a fist but I cant make one Im frozen stiff I yell but nothing comes out Im crying inside I shout My vocal cords wont permit me I scream but its not aloud You put your arm around Momma to calm her wow I just thought about the aisle Ill never get to walk us down Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns Its bout to be hows this happening now Ive got so much more to do And Proof Im truly sorry if I let you down but this tore me in two The thought of no more me and you You gave me shoes Nikes like new for me for school Doody Im trying but you you were the glue that binded So many things time Id give anything to rewind it I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded By pictures all on my walls and I couldnt sleep at night cause That image burned in my brain of you on that table Me falling across your body not able to stand to save you God why did you take him Im tryna keep his legacy alive but Im dying wheres Nathan Little ladies be brave take care of your mother Smile pretty for pictures always cherish each other Ill always love ya and Ill be in the back of your memory And I know youll never forget me Just dont get sad when remembering And little bro keep making me proud You better marry that girl cause shes faithfully down And when youre exchanging those sacred vows Just know that if I could be there I would And should you ever see parenthood I know youll be good at it Oh almost forgot to do something thank my father too I actually learned a lot from you You taught me what not to do And Mom wish Id have had the chance To have one last heart to heart honest and open talk with you Doody I see you I go to walk to you And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room Nurses lean over the bed pulling tubes out Then the sheet over my head shut the room down Girls please dont get upset I see them cheeks soaking and wet As you squeeze hold of my neck so forcibly dont wanna let Me go pillow drenched emotional wrecks With every second each closer to death But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow Then a breath machines go Mustve guessed the cheat codes to this shit Im tryna rewind time like a tape Find an escape make a beeline try and awake From this dream I need to re find my inner strength To remind me even if a steep climb I must take To rewrite a mistake Im rewinding the tape Ill put out this last album then Im done with it One hundred percent finished fed up with it Im hanging it up fuck it Excuse the cursing baby but just know That Im a good person though they portray me as cold And if things should worsen but I bet you they wont Im pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet Shred these old letters I wrote All that old pathetic loathing closing credits can roll Im proud to be back Im bout to like a rematch outdo Relapse With Recovery Mathers LP Help propel me to victory laps Gas toward em and fast forward the past Consider them last four minutes as The song Ida sang to my daughters If Ida made it to the hospital less than hours later but I fought it And came back like a boomerang on em Now a new day is dawnin Im up Tuesday its mornin now I know Embed

Framed Lyrics Feeling kinky lip syncing to Too horts Freaky Tales Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like shes decals But when murdering females Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail If you get scratched because your DNAll Be all up under her fingernails Man he hears you I dont think he cares He gives a fuck even his pinky swears Three personalities burstin out of me please beware Her TV blares cant hear the creaking stairs Shes unaware in no underwear shes completely bare Turns around and screams I remember distinctly I said Im here to do sink repairs Chop her up put her body parts In front of Steven Averys trailer and leave em there But hey man I was framed I know what this looks like officers Please just give me one minute I think I can explain I aint murdered nobody I know these words are so nutty But Im just here to entertain How come your shirt is so bloody Theres a missing person so what Hes Got nothin to do with me Im almost certain I was framed Woke up it was dawn musta knew somethin was wrong Think Im becomin a monster cause of the drugs that Im on Donald Ducks on theres a Tonka Truck in the yard But dog how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it Must go above and beyond cause its incumbent upon me Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde Girl that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond Second murder with no recollection of it Collectin newspaper articles cuttin out sections from it Memorys too fucked to remember destructive temper Cut my public defenders jugular then stuck him up in a blender Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably Cause the disassembled body Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly Im wanted for questioning Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me But hey man I was framed I know what this looks like officers Please just give me one minute I think I can explain I aint murdered nobody I know these words are so nutty But Im just here to entertain How come your shirt is so bloody Theres a missing person so what Hes Got nothin to do with me Im almost certain I was framed Still on the loose they Spotted me inside McDonalds Tuesday In a Toronto Blue Jays cap lookin like your college roommate With Rihanna Lupe Saddam Hussein Bobby Boucher Or was it Cool J The cops is on a goose chase Just escaped from the state pen For eight women who hate men Dont make it no weirder Im naked When I break in your basement Under your babys play pen I lay in wait adjacent Facin the door remainin patient while stayin complacent Blatant sexual implications are continuin to get thrown Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems Left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home Youll get the hint ho Im in your window But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene In a verse and be charged with first degree Cause it just happened to match up perfectly With the massacre or the Burger King burglary No officer you see I was framed I know what this looks like officers Please just give me one minute I think I can explain I aint murdered nobody I know these words are so nutty But Im just here to entertain How come your shirt is so bloody Theres a missing person so what Hes Got nothin to do with me Im almost certain I was framed Embed
Alfred s Theme Lyrics Before I check the mic I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe Coronavirus in effect tonight Antiseptics on deck I got every type I throw on my tux then I give zero fucks then I Act like a jockstrap cup my nuts then I Check my ball hair make sure its all there Then call the pallbearer Its Music to B Murdered By again why stop Overkill lik a pipe bomb in your pine box Youre all hitched to my cock Went from punchin a time clock to getting my shot Then treated it like a cyclops Like its the only one I got And my thoughts are like nines cocked Every lines obscene pervertedest mind got the dirtiest rhyme stocked Thats why theres parental advising every time I drop So throw on the theme to Alfred Ill channel him like the Panama Canal But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out Bitch I still get the bag when Im putting garbage out Plus the potty mouth Im not about to wash it out The filthiest so all this talk about Im washed up how preposterous Because if cleanliness is next to godliness Its obvious that its impossible for me to be beside myself And Im bout that capital like a proper noun Still on top the pile Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial Quick to call you out on your bullshit Dont make me give that crock a dial Cause if I do it see you later alligator Made it out the trailer then I made a vow to cater to no one So hate Ive gained about the same amount thats in my bank account So heres some more shit for you to complain about I say the Bars that never slack but always get attacked I think theyre gunnin for me its startin to feel like that Like Im marked cause when I rap its like fallin on my back in a tar pit Cause I have this target on my back But if I ever double crossed my fans and lost my Stans Id probably pop five Xans Go in my garage start my van Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can And doze off like snores But odds like that with these thoughts I haves like a giant getting squashed by ants If this is the test of time Id pass with flying colors Like I just tossed my crayons Small medium and large size cans Sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and If my palms brush across my pants I wash my hands Shit hold on man Motherfuck Happy birthday to Fuck I sit in silence in candlelit environments Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent Homicidal visions when Im spitting like this But really Im just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes Which is really childish and silly but Im really like this Im giving nightmares to Billie Eilish Im Diddys side bitch What the fuck Hold on wait Im Diddys side bitch Oh Im still east side bitch So til the E N D since EPMD Been givin yall the business D R E and me From the MMLP to MTBMB Bitch its you still aint seein me So call me Santa Claus Cause at the present I out rap em all Im at the mall Got your bitch in a bathroom stall she could suck a basketball Through a plastic straw with a fractured jaw My dick is coat check she wanna jack it off Im so far past the bar I should practice law Mentally Im fucked up generally Dukes of Hazzard car get the cadaver dogs Cause this is murder murder and youll get murked murked This music bout to kill you brr brr This chicken hit my phone she said Chirp chirp I said Hut hut hike your skirt skirt Then go eat some worms like the early bird What the fuck is love Thats a dirty word Make me fall in it theres not a girl on Earth Or any other planet thats a world of hurt And I wont buy her designer cause I dont pander But Im back with so many knots I need a chiropractor And this the final chapter cause Im either frying after Or they gon give me the needle like a vinyl scratcher Yeah Im a card like Hallmark At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art And yall who claim to be dogs arent No bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf But yall pickin the wrong tree they call me dog because Im barking And I got a lot yeah like where cars park Id describe it as bowling ball hard Cause the gutters where my mind is and when Its in this frame better split like the five and the ten Cause without a second to spare Im strikin again And when the beat is up my alley I go right for the pens The cypher begins Im talkin smack like heroin the mics a syringe Its like a binge Vicodin I would liken to tin My mind is a recycling bin Theres no place I never been But I never budge and I never bend You hyperextend on me this games life it depends Like adult diapers for men Even when Im rappin less stellar Its sour grapes I still whine Im the best seller Like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through Dres booth And go straight through your grapefruit no escape route So you wont leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you But if bars were semi macs Id be the Mad Hatter Cause I got so many caps and you dont have any straps So youd be a fitted so dont act like you fittin to snap Bitch Ill pee on your head like a Phillies hat No stoppin me youre on a window shopping spree Bitch you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree You never buy shit all you ever cops a plea Youre always punkin out like Halloween You rather opt to flee you need to stop it punk Homie youre not a G act like you got the pump And youre gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump Bitch if you shot a tree you wouldnt pop the trunk Yeah and Im buddies with Alfred we about to Disembowel them gut em and scalp em yeah This is bout to be the bloodiest outcome Cause we gon make you bleed with every cut from this album So Im choppin em up like Dahmer The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt Im in the cut and Im out for the blood Its lookin like its that time of the month Carvin em up with the bars while I sharpen em up dog and a mutt Im gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer fuckin phenomenal but Yall will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you dont v monos I keep droppin like dominos the formidable abominable Stompin a mudhole in my comp even if its off the top of the dome Son em get the Coppertone Im at the Stop and Go coppin the Mop and Glo Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope You out of pocket though like a motherfuckin wallet stole Wait whyd the beat cut off Fuck it Embed

make rape Russell docs Nah Yeah Bitch you have never said a clever line ever You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth Rest assured Ima treat this roof like Im peelin off The plastic on a pill bottle Im tearin the ceilin off yeah Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran bitch And Im strapped up with ammunition And single handedly takin over the game like I had an actual hand missing But I only need one to clap Animal ambition The only butt fuckin way that youre strapped is for cash Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin imaginary little handgun youre brandishin Bitch if you pull up with the stick Its a car with a manual transmission The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one Voodoo dolls Im just pokin fun pins to me are like loaded guns When Im holdin one if Im just fiddlin with it This motherfucker discharges like me checkin myself out of the fucking mental hospital And I get off like an acquittal I spit it you critique it It feels like Im bein belittled by midgets Its like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka And walkin right up in the middle of a little kids fuckin pillow fight with it You want smoke Im like hookah Man I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas Run home and go fuck my room up These streets will try to vacuum you up Thats why the avenue where I grew up was Mile and Hoover Cause it sucked like a Roomba But even if I wouldve went the indie route I dont have any doubt I would still get blown like its windy out Shoot til the clip is emptied out This is the beginning of the ending but Ill put another clip in and spit these rounds If I dig deep down when Im in my bag like Fendi Who am I offending now Got so many fucking detractors feels like Im gettin plowed Had to put my money on a diet I got too many pounds You would think Im turnin pages the way that Im flippin paper Middle fingers them bitches get to wavin like friendly neighbors Im talkin loot like Im rioting Dick is so big I cant fit the entire thing through a tire swing I dont think itd be logic for me to say that Im retirin But I should say bye bye earthlings Cause Im back on Uranus fuckin up this Grindin beat yeah I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart So when Im rippin its hard to tell whether if it is really because Of how offensive I am or just what a bitch that you are Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St Vincent de Paul Like I dont make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp and Im quick on the draw Yeah so when I pull it surprise like Kendrick Lamar You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog Cause yall are missing a heart Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz This shit is like sitting in the principals office getting scolded for skipping Yall got detention tomorrow Im severe like Benzo withdrawal Bitch your skins gonna crawl Im invincible Ive been through it all Like I never thought about just ending it til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall My back was against Now I rap like Im possessed thats nine tenths of the law Oh Oh fuck it Embed

Bad Husband Lyrics We never saw from each others sides or eye to eye Just eye for eye lie for lie fight or flight So much baggage need a luggage rack But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds Up back in the news love taps when I dissed you Like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth Jump back in the studio give you a tongue lashing then you Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone It was funny back in our youth But then it wasn t after we knew That we were done and actually through But if theres one fraction of truth If it could be spun back I would do So many things different Cause it was such a dumbass excuse You hit me once and that I would use To continue the pattern of abuse Why did I punch back Girls your dad is a scumbag I m confused Because How come you can be a lord and a loser How come how come you can be a liar and a good father A good dad but a bad husband Why are you a good father A great dad but a bad husband You were the beat I loved with a writers block The line thats hot that I forgot We laughed a little cried a lot Ill never forget when you came home and you held Hailie Day before you went to jail and daily How wed wait for that mail lady Or by the phone for Mom to call And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on Givin it one more try despite it all Youre my lightning rod when my sky gets dark Im your shiny rocks in that tiny box When we tied the knot when we broke the knot Every line we crossed we were supposed to not Every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far Words that we said that we didn t mean The words that we meant that we didn t say The ones that we thought that we shoulda said Letters written that we coulda read Which maybe woulda led to some good instead And had this put to bed But Id be lyin still if I said I wasnt sittin here askin myself How come you can be a lord and a loser How come how come you can be a liar and a good father A good dad but a bad husband Why are you a good father A great dad but a bad husband Forever be a hero in my eyes But there s always another side to a good father A great dad but a bad husband We brought out the worst in each other Someone had to make the sparring end Cause I loved you but I hated that me And I dont wanna see that side again But Im sorry Kim More than you could ever comprehend Leavin you was fuckin harder than Sawing off a fuckin body limb Once upon a time were all we had Maybe thats what drew us To each other it was true love Shit we never knew was possible We might have loved each other too much And maybe thats what made us do what We did to each other all the screw ups Cause you always thought that you was More in love with me And I was thinkin I was more in love than you was For all the times that we thought it worked Til we saw how wrong we were When the dust settles now and all the dirt If I touch the rawest nerve All I want is for us not to hurt And its been an exhaustive search to find the words But I just heard Mockingbird And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds Ive caused a few and so have you Or argue whose fault it was Partly yours partly mine but really no ones This is so tough Im gettin choked up Oh fuck it we both suck We broke up got back together We both thought we had forever Not bad people just bad together We were so nuts backstabbed each other Another blow struck but theres no duckin this blow Cause its over and its closure But Im not so sure how to close this I just dont know how some people can be so good At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother Shit its no wonder How come how come you can be a lord and a loser How come how come you can be a liar and a good father A good dad but a bad husband Why are you a good father A great dad but a bad husband Forever be a hero in my eyes But theres always another side to a good father A great dad but a bad husband Embed

Armstrong Man I still say K Marts like theres an apostrophe s on it dog And they say McDonalds isn t a restaurant well I guess I m wrong But if youre gonna tell me that A W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg And on my throne I remain all alone in my lane I m as strong as they king they were gone fore they came Now I don t wanna hang I slap five with them rap guys They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty thats why Now I don t really care what you call me You can even call me cold I bet they knew as soon as they saw me Goodnight it s over with thats all she wrote I roll like a desperado Now I never know where I m gonna go But still I ball like there s no tomorrow Goodnight it s over with thats all she wrote All she wrote all she wrote I said it s over with thats all she wrote All she wrote all she wrote Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote Embed
Rock Bottom Lyrics Ayo this song is dedicated To all the happy people All the happy people who have real nice lives And have no idea what its like to be broke as fuck I feel like Im walkin a tight rope without a circus net Poppin Percocet Im a nervous wreck I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check Im bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged Full of venom and rage specially when Im engaged And my daughters down to her last diaper its got my ass hyper I pray that God answers maybe Ill ask nicer Watchin ballers while they flossin in they Pathfinders These overnight stars becomin autograph signers We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us Along with the small fries and average half pinters But player haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us Moneyll brainwash you and leave yo ass mindless Them snakes slither in the grass spineless Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams Im hopin things look up but there aint no job openings I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished Livin in this house with no furnace unfurnished And Im sick of workin dead end jobs with lame pay And Im tired of bein hired and fired the same day But fuck it if you know the rules to the game play Cause when we die we know we all goin the same way Cause its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan When all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan Or comfortable and roomy in a But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today My daughter wants to throw the ball but Im too stressed to play Live half my life and throw the rest away Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear Theres people that love me and people that hate me But its the evil that made me This backstabbin deceitful and shady I want the money the women the fortune and fame That means I end up burnin in Hell scorchin in flame That means Im stealin your checkbook and forgin your name This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain Cause right now I feel like Ive just hit the rock bottom Ive got problems now everybody on my blocks got em Im screamin like them two cops when Pac shot em Holdin two Glocks hope your doors got new locks on em My daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em And them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on em And while you flaunt em I could be takin em to shops to pawn em I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want em Cause I aint never went gold off one song Im runnin up on someones lawn with guns drawn Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear Thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill Thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal Thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear Thats rock bottom Embed

Frown while I shit on your crown skip town Ground zero Shapiro the king cash cow Do I make em say Wow Strip Bow I sit with the pound Click Blaow Click click Click Stop traffic dropping them classics flip now Bitches I m making them skip with thou Art you don t really want start when I growl Let me come and mop up the knockoffs When I pop off and never stop cause When we do come through you better lock doors The wolves wanna eat peep how they lock jaws No need to cook up the coke you see We cop raw And if you ain t had enough What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergn gen fuck is going on Back with the B A Baracus callous bang on another song I mma have these niggas nervous And clipping they nails and dribbling And witness them nibble them like sunflower seed shells See these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales And I shit on these males till its stinkin Fouler than a weed smell nigga your tree fell See how they Twitter Facebook and Instagramming an email Talking Im sick I got them shook and I bang em at retail Until they cripple see I cook like I m slanging a weed sale Until I triple bred and whoop em and drag em like females Oh see well these niggas already know The way that I fuck shit up minus the details the case is shut Your bitch remind me of replacement butt Kind of an ancient slut its going down Like she was a basement fuck Swell up this shit like I m sticking steaks in they gut So gracefully and graciously I painfully wake niggas up Ragdolling these niggas and attacking Like apes in the cut I m waiting for the taking While I break niggas neck like a bracelet It s kinda like me having a case in the truck And drinking til I m blasted Harassing and erase a nigga Keeping em open and blacking until I m leaving em stuck And got em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck While I m chasing a buck These funny niggas be chasing they luck I be lacing them up like boots When I m pushing they face in the mud Missiles I fling while I spit live wire Til this shit circling back around With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound While I light up shit thatll cause a quick worship And gather around its certain this shitll splatter cliques Painful and make em scatter Shameful the way I shatter Shit apart it doesnt matter Your head up off your shoulders Bullets bigger than a boulder And they break em and they know its And the way it s going you could easily get your See me and Shady together we re crazy Like baking a vomit and rabies cake like a pastry bitch Like I come from Haiti I m suggesting you pay me don t make me wanna spaz Like I m a crazy Israeli While I bite the beat up and Im starting to heat up I m chopping your foot off Now it s mine and I m putting my feet up Back to the hood and off to the wild And I m hoping you protect your child And I been blacking out so long Niggas is asking if the hook had died nah But the beat is fried Yo Ayo calm down nigga Ayo calm down nigga Ayo calm down nigga Ayo calm down nigga Ayo calm down nigga Fuck it blackout niggas Apparently theres a light contagiousness to this tirade It just might make you sick so irate With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg Is my mind scrambled Cause Im lit narrow minded But go through such a wide range of this emotion That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways I just pulled up in Clive Daviss driveway With his personal memoir saying Hes bi Waving a nine a picket sign egging his ride Making him cry Rape then arrive naked And drive straight through the gay pride parade Yay Yippee Ki Yay cause here I Wait did the world just pee on my leg And should I take it as a sign Maybe to take em back into time I stuck out like a sore thumb so I gave em the finger To take the attention away From my stinking face it was bringing Changed the whole complexion of the game But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing The kingpin of crazy youre wasting your ink then So if this is any indication of what you may be facing You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations Are leaving a bad taste fuck making a bad impression Thats the worst impersonation Ive ever seen and Who raps nasally Eyes hazely Rhymes crazily but sounds like he may Need some Flonase when hes speaking What kind of stupid question is that Hey Mrs Abraham Lincoln Other than your husbands fucking brains that were leaking Howd you think that play was this weekend You aint the real Slim Shady sit your ass down faggot See me on a ballot Im running for class clown Rich Democrat bitch so Im just the candidate To come fuck up the whole party Me and Flipmode starting a campaign To have every campus on a fucking rampage Act my goddamn age I am eight So lets get smashed and wake up the next day With the room trashed covered in Band Aids Glass ashtray smashed Champagne splashed on the lampshades But this aint up for debate this is undebatable Shady for president ho dont make me go take it back To the days of old with Sway Tech radio When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show Fuck you telling me fools I was rippin shop raisin hell up in Drews When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet Youre fucking with vets dog fucking internet bloggers I sit in front of my computer all day And comment on everything Im an expert on everything Everything sucks play the next song Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop you idiot prick With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you Id be dead wrong Son of God Im the S O G Like a wet log pores never get clogged Cause Im so full of self esteem that I sweat fog Yes yes y all steady on the left y all Step off fore you get stepped on Soft Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet Jealousy ll get you green as a Chia Pet I can see that you re visibly upset dog Alert alert girl alert Once you enter in my house of pain youre in a world of hurt So Get that ass shaking Came to hit you with a fan favorite But if you too fly for coach better get them arms And freaking hands flailing and Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind More afraid of success than I am of failure So what does that tell ya That on a grand scale I don t give a fuck about nothing Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail Before he ran straight into the damn railing Yo chill man chill Embed

Eminem Gets Verified on Genius LyricsLet the horns blow Eminem has annotated selections from his entire catalog for Genius Below are a few highlights to see all the annotations go to Eminems profile page Eminem recalled his first studio session with Dr Dre and the creation of My Name Is a song that was recorded in one take and launched him into superstardom Dre put on the Labi Siffre record and I was just like Hi My name is That beat was talking to me I was like Yo this is it this is my shot If I don t impress this guy I m going back home and I m fucked I knew Dre wasn t an easy person to please I made sure that everything he had a beat for I had a rhyme ready to go or I came up with a rhyme on the spot My Name Is was the first thing that came out of my mouth that first day I was at Dre s house I don t know if we released what I did the first day or if I re did it but it was basically the same I didn t understand punching or believe in it So I would just go from the top of the song all the way down I was never flying in hooks Everything was live one take If I got all the way to the fucking end and messed up the last word I d be like Run it back let s do it again I remember Dre was like Yo are you fucking crazy Let s just punch I didn t like that concept because I wasn t used to it When we were recording here in Detroit in the beginning I was saving up my money to go in We only had an hour you know I m like One take down alright let s go to the next song Fuck it That s what I was used to Marshall explained where the name Slim Shady came from in an annotation on the song Just Dont Give A Fuck Coming out with an alias was part of Proof s whole idea He said Let s be in a group called D and there will be six of us and we ll each have an alias We ll each be two different people When I started rapping as Shady as that character it was a way for me to vent all my frustrations and just blame it on him If anybody got mad about it it was him that said it you know what I m saying It was a way for me to be myself and say what I felt I never wanted to go back to just rapping regular again In another annotation on the same song Eminem explained that he started writing songs like Just Dont Give A Fuck because people were saying that I sounded like AZ and Nas Em broke down a few lyrics from Lose Yourself clarifying whose sweater the vomit was on in the first verse The first verse is all about Jimmy Smith Jr It s me talking about Jimmy Smith Jr like I m not saying my sweater I m saying his I m trying to show you what his life is about On the original demo version of Lose Yourself This is going to sound stupid but I have no recollection of the demo version on Shady XV I don t know where I recorded it I don t even know when I recorded it I did a lot of drugs so my memory is all over the place On how the lyrics of Didos Thank You helped inspire Stan When I heard your picture on my wall I was like Yo this could be about somebody who takes me too seriously So I knew what I was going to write about before I wrote it A lot of times when I m writing songs I see visions for everything I m writing This was one of those On the decision to make In Da Club the first single off Cents Interscope debut We couldn t decide on the first single from Get Rich It was going to be either If I Can t or In Da Club We were torn so me Paul Chris Lighty and Jimmy Iovine decided to flip a coin On Jay Zs Renegade Em explained his thought process when writing When I m writing I m in the syllable game I m connecting syllable phrases where every syllable rhymes I get heavy into that When I start rapping something and I think of more syllables that connect with it sometimes I want to just keep the scheme going forever I ve done it before in songs where the syllable scheme of the first verse ends up being the syllable scheme of the second verse and the third verse all the way down I do it because the lines start connecting and making sense Once I find something and lock in it comes out pretty quick Marshall also annotated a fan favorite Sing For The Moment explaining why he kept going despite the criticism he received early in his career This is where I was dealing with critics who didn t understand why people were identifying with me I realized I was becoming like the rappers that I looked up to as a kid I identified with and loved LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys I felt like if everybody didn t understand their music it didn t matter they were speaking to me So that s what I was trying to make people realize on this track I may not be shit to you but there s a kid in fucking Nebraska or somewhere that I m talking to I don t care if you re listening because he s listening That s who I m directing my material at On Rap God Marshall said the only thing he would do other than rhyme is play for the Detroit Lions The hook was the first phrase I thought of when I heard the track I thought Okay this has something to it and might be catchy but I m a rap god Why If I m going to say that I need to validate that I don t want to say it s the crutch exactly but the theme of the whole song is this is the only thing I know how to do I don t know how to do anything else aside from play a little bit of basketball Except if the Lions called me I m down to be receiver or something or a running back I d be good for that Eminem also annotated a vintage Biggie Pac Freestyle from commenting on past and present MCs There s people who rap to make songs just because they enjoy doing it and want to express themselves And then there are people who rap competitively I believe that anybody who competitively raps like Drake and Kendrick and Jay Z raps to be the best rapper People diss each other but it s more in the vein of How can I kill you with record sales Or with a flow How can I be better than you at making records at punchlines metaphors wordplay syllables But when you have two rappers like Biggie and Pac getting into it you get the hip hop community torn No one wants to see something real happen If for a second you entertain the idea of that being entertaining if something ever happened out of that No That s not healthy Click

ShadyXV Lyrics Im liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog Night club shit I was taught If your CDs on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park No fire department so you might not hear sirens at all But dont be alarmed if I sound off Something just aint right with me dog A martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder Widely regarded highly Bite me sweetheart Im slightly retarded but tonight Im startin Shit Im feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit Lookin to box with anybody disorderly conduct Ill fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of The LOX bananas manic Im going in shock Frantic Im trapped in a closet Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic No faggot I mean I cant maneuver for movement Cause I have no room for improvement Im practically squashed compacted and boxed in Toxic cans of arsenic flammable bars examine the content Bar exam start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls cannibal jaws Shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter Looking skantless as Hannibals stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets Black out Zach Galifianakis Gallons of Vodka but that gal has some knockers I betcha they ring a bell when I come back and Im conscious What happened doc I passed out again Alcohols making me break into vacants naked Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it Woke up shortly thereafter hungover No underwear grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Maxes in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is a cross mixing Of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin Fin cotton Dockers OshKoshes drop crotches Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas But its like being overstaffed at a boxing gym With all these trainers but I dont have any boxers And Im standing here naked hangover still wasted Like paper you write raps on obnoxious Yo why does it always sound like Im grabbing my nostrils Fuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall I ll stand there and yell that at a wall Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects That Im battering all shatter and fall Cause I hear the track and Im starting to get fucking amped Im a spark plug Im like the car with the cables Hooked up to my fucking back Im a Duracell But I sure as hell got it backwards cause yall get jumped And Ill catch the battery charge but I got a hunch like your back when its arching When I start attacking your squadron Youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers So get the sack like Wisconsin Thats nutbag that Im talking who am I kidding You faggots are all gonna do my bidding Dont get dragged to the auction Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all Ill push a bitch into oncoming traffic just watch this Stretched tinted black sedan my ass See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping Affable guy next doors laughable My next whores gonna have mechanical arms Thatll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard I got a Magic Johnson Its like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi she Slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her God dammit I am a misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony Just so happens shes fond of algae Cause now she

know what was hittin if it hit him Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit Before me and Shady who was thinkin bout Detroit We put the world onto it so watch how you say fuck me You just might jinx yourself whoops your girl gon do it Cause I was in that in Chicago at the same time I had already been grindin since thats longevity And if you think youre lyrically better you better be a killer Oh yeah You aint ever seen a motherfucker get realer Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose Cause aint nobody iller no one nobody for realer This elite drinker is the ringleader Im a deep thinker Im a street preacher With a street sweeper full of heat seekers In your Jeep speakers Ima keep ringers I dont need heaters I got the meat cleaver Welcome to the slaughterhouse Niggas try to tell me I spell too much Capital S to the laugh to the T E R Ho U S E now go to hell you fucks word Making work disappear quick as magic Abracadabra the trafficker blacker than Africa Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood Money like Dracula has him a spatula ask me a question Am I the best with the flexing Fuck yes with the goon talk I just moonwalk all over the beat then Im lightin up the street CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller Oh yeah You aint ever seen a motherfucker get realer Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose Cause aint nobody iller no one nobody for realer Feelin it in the air breathe it in the night Staring at the full moon Did you ever think you would come to find Maybe in my dreams The thought of retiring is makin me want To set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and What up ma Im applyin for the rim job are you hirin Im hopin to fill up your openin Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements First I gotta accept youre in a lobby in Ireland And youve probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am In no mood to be playin second fiddle slob on this violin With no strings attached Im just the product of a hostile environment But bein brought up so wrought up inspired But I dont know why its still like Im caught up inside a whirlpool Not an appliance but applyin this science I psychotically rhyme And its like stars have aligned all in alliance Heart of a lion balls of Goliath Obscene talk intertwined like a beanstalk and a vine But I keep walkin the line between the wrong and the right But everything I write seems wrong and its like Im ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause In the fabric of our modern society Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back To my old antics and shenanigans dammit the Popes mad again Probably shouldntve ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin Singin Bagpipes from Baghdad again In my dads drag draggin a faggot in a GLAAD bag Wont be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again You thought I was lyin when I said I think that Im crossin the line again Ive lost my mind caution oh God I think I just thought of another fucking line Forgive me father for I have sinned But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak Defiant now the odds of me tryin to fuckin be quiet Probably gotta be bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant After hes fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive colony tryin to sneak by it While his feet stomp follow me while I revive rap Ima start up a rioting try to stop it or silence it Youre not gonna might as well just hit the block in your joggin attire in Boston across the marathon finish line than to Put your thoughts against mine Cause the arsenal I havell scar you for life worse than Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with bombs pliers and barbed wire Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking Swiss army knife A saberless Darth Vader with arthritis in a bar fight With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up Im Dahmer like when Im on the mic Im not gonna lie Perform like Im gonna die at the end of a song so its hard for the rhyme to end Like fuck em all Im just ridin Like I m locked up inside of a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car Uncle Ronnie was driving bout to burst through the side door Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room Oh yeah You aint ever seen a motherfucker get realer Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose Cause aint nobody iller no one nobody for realer Embed
BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher Lyrics Its the calm before the storm right here Wait how was I gonna start this off I forgot oh yeah Thats an awfully hot coffee pot Should I drop it on Donald Trump Probably not But thats all I got til I come up with a solid plot Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk Ima walk inside a mosque on Ramadan And say a prayer that every time talks She gets her mou ahh Ima stop But we better give Obama props Cause what we got in office nows a kamikaze Thatll probably cause a nuclear holocaust And while the drama pops And he waits for shit to quiet down hell just gas his plane up And fly around til the bombing stops Intensities heightened tensions are risin Trump when it comes to givin a shit youre stingy as I am Except when it comes to havin the balls to go against me you hide em Cause you dont got the fuckin nuts like an empty asylum Racisms the only thing hes fantastic for Cause thats how he gets his fuckin rocks off and hes orange Yeah sick tan Thats why he wants us to disband Cause he cannot withstand The fact were not afraid of Trump Fuck walkin on egg shells I came to stomp Thats why he keeps screamin Drain the swamp Cause hes in quicksand Its like we take a step forwards then backwards But this is his form of distraction Plus he gets an enormous reaction When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in stead of talkin Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada All these horrible tragedies and hes bored and would rather Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers Then says he wants to lower our taxes Then whos gonna pay for his extravagant trips Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered Then does it more From his endorsement of Bannon Support for the Klansmen Tiki torches in hand for the soldier thats black And comes home from Iraq And is still told to go back to Africa Fork and a dagger in this racist year old grandpa Who keeps ignorin our past historical deplorable factors Now if youre a black athlete youre a spoiled little brat for Tryna use your platform or your stature To try to give those a voice who dont have one He says Youre spittin in the face of vets who fought for us you bastards Unless youre a POW whos tortured and battered Cause to him youre zeros Cause he dont like his war heroes captured Thats not disrespectin the military Fuck that this is for Colin ball up a fist And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch Hes gonna get rid of all immigrants Hes gonna build that thing up taller than this Well if he does build it I hope its rock solid with bricks Cause like him in politics Im usin all of his tricks Cause Im throwin that piece of shit against the wall til it sticks And any fan of mine whos a supporter of his Im drawing in the sand a line youre either for or against And if you cant decide who you like more and youre split On who you should stand beside Ill do it for you with this Fuck you The rest of America stand up We love our military and we love our country But we fuckin hate Trump Embed

Under the Influence Lyrics Chem le le le le le le le le le le le Chem le le le ne miah nuf niah ne nish ne ne So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Two pills I pop til my pupils swell up like two pennies Im Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back Of his ass so the rats cant chew through his last pants Im like a mummy at night fightin with bright lightnin And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin him Im like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls I light a candle and place it up on the mantel Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin Cause once youre hung from the drapes its curtains Im an instigator slug penetrator Degradin creatin murders to kill haters Accused for every crime known through the equator They knew I did it for havin blood on my gators My weedll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and Im a black grenade thatll blow up in yo face With a fifth in me when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose You never hear me say Forgive me Im snatchin every penny it gotta be that way nigga face it That weed I sold to you Brigade laced it You hidin I make the President get a facelift Niggas just afraid handin me they bracelets Chillin in the lab wasted Im the type Thatll drink Kahlua and gin throw up on the mic Your life is ruined you get socked right on sight And even at the Million Man March we gon fight So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Cause I dont give a fuck if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

skip Lettin the record skip lettin the record skip Im fuckin anything when Im snortin Its gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion Some bitch asked for my autograph I called her a whore spit beer in her face and laughed I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam All bitches is hoes even my stinkin ass mom Ayo flashback two feets two deep up in that ass crack Weed laced with somethin nigga pass that In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats At a Stop the Violence rally I blast gats BMI on publishin get yo ass capped The Kuniva divide up yo cash stack Run yo motherfuckin pockets ASAP I dont need a platinum chain bitch I snatched Shaqs Born loser half thief and half black Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked And found chopped up in a trash bag We stranglin rappers until the point they cant yell Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales Reckless come from behind and snatch your necklace Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums I grapple your Adams apple until it crackle Run right past you turn around grab you and stab you Get executed cause Im a Luni I got a Yukmouth And its polluted I cock it back then shoot it I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers Shoot up the household even the young toddlers Brigade barricade to bring the noise While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys If I go solo Im doin a song with Bolo A big Chinese nigga screamin Kuniva yo yo I leave ya face leakin run up in church And smack the preacher while hes preachin Take a swing at the deacon I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight I was straight til I got caught sellin them shake Im ignorant with the intent to snatch your rent I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent With the superintendents daughter my brains out of order Ive been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von Who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb I sign to a local label for fun Say I got cancer get dropped take the advancement and run Drive by you in the rain while you carry your son Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun Got a reputation for havin niggas runnin they funds Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some ones Til I met your fat mama now Im rollin in dough So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Cause I dont give a fuck if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when

Farewell Lyrics Ricky Racks For what its worth You were a slut at birth If the world had a dick Youd fuck the Earth I tried to get over you It doesnt work Youre still a cunt Im still a fucking jerk Same as it ever was yeah Say itll change but it never does Aint gonna ever cause Youre the cause of my pain and the medicine Never met someone who played games with my head as much Fate tethered us together like two felons Mustve fell in love with skeletons Everyones got em thought that you were Cinderella but Feels like I slept with the wicked stepmother But how the hell am I Still in love with the motherfucking chick theres at least a million of They say love the one you with But this shit is killing us Our loves on some other shit Im a glutton for punishment Youre the gloves Im the punching mitts Its above and beyond us Cuffing Im shoving the girl I love inside of an oven If I catch you sucking another dick You better unsuck it you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again Why am I tucking you in Probably cause I gotta tell myself another lie Cause thats what helps to get me by Cause Im in Hell This is my goodbye farewell Wanna hold you wanna choke you wanna love you Wanna hate you wanna kill you wanna hurt you Wanna heal you yeah Wanna lose you keep you bruise you Beat abuse you treat you mutual Its juvenile delusional as usual Youre beautiful Im average Im brutal youre a savage My ride or die chick whos always cruising for a bruising Yeah its kinda like were tryna light a dynamite stick Though we might get along like shit Fight hit bite spit unite split Yeah youre awful but youre mine And they say love is blind we see each other fine But its no wonder Im the only one youll find To put up with your shit I need a plumber line But nothing comes to mind besides the number Cause since you flipped my fucking life upside down Now the skys ground look at my frown its a smile now Look at my mouth its my eyebrows make it rain upwards Were on that ninth cloud two insane lovebirds I should fly south cause man am I great aint lyin to myself But Im just plain stubborn Im Audi five thou But this is my house bitch you get out Then we duke it out then it dies down Then we say Fuck it cry our eyes out Then I gotta tell myself another lie Cause thats what helps to get me by Cause Im in Hell This is my goodbye farewell This relationship is all that its cracked up to be Never lack lust in that cause we act nuts Cause thats what attracts us Trick you with a back rub Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub Yeah now thats love may sound pathetic But fuck the world cause they out to get us I love you but I wont exchange vows Hey now dont get carried away No way Ill get married itll take a rain cloud to wed us Yeah but were so insane bout each other May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau Break out Berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together Who knows how its gonna play out Or whether deaths what our ending will be One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee But Ill go to bat for you defending your honor Yeah no contingency fees something we re not nah Were not pretending to beef dont cost a penny to be with me Time were spending is free we could be broke as a joke Wont make a difference to me dont have to give me a thing Couldve been a cent ring from out of a vending machine Love unconditionally theres no other fish in the sea Guess Im a prisoner see addiction is a disease I gotta tell myself another lie Cause thats what helps to get me by Cause Im in Hell This is my goodbye farewell Love you girl do you feel the same I dont wanna play games no games ah Youre the only one that can out my flame Baby just play it straight straight no games ah Embed

Book of Rhymes Lyrics I dont smile I dont frown get too up or get too down I was here so were you you came and went I stuck around Still here now stop me how Your opinions like a broken calculator That shit doesnt count Shut your motherfuckin mouth Im emptyin my book of rhymes Get em all off my pad every thought that I had I said Im emptyin my book of rhymes Get em all off my pad every thought that I had Havent used all the tricks I have so like my balls Im in my bag Get a littl teste when Im mad sick of wr stling this iPad Unsuccessfully I might add And I know its best to leave it lie But even I get obsessed with reading everything And let it get the best of me til I snap But I need to get off the internet I need to get on the mic You need to get off the internet You need to get you a life Why you waste time just to comment on shit Especially shit you dont like Dont like it dont listen but dont tell me bout your favorite rapper rippin some shit he didnt write What happened to Slim He was no cap with the pen He used to rap like the people his music was for He was exactly like them The dude who used to be poor why cant he tap into him Cant use that excuse anymore Hes mad at the wind hes in a nuclear war With a cloud hes yellin at it again I talked to your mother she told me she loved me All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me Wants nobody but me she showed me the Dougie Can I get a witness like notary public She said Kick some fly shit I said I got wings on my ass Told her my dicks a cockpit I fly by the seat of my pants Sinful thoughts this beat is crazy this shits retarded This instrus mental to mini bars incidental charges When did it start I been cold hearted in this heart since kindergarten Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office bitch I invented flossin Yeah I used to wonder where my next meals gonna come from Now I just wonder where my next mills gonna come from I cannot have no success unless when I finally make it I get to remind all the haters who shitted on me when Im on my way up My floor is yall fools ceilings If I was you I would step or find yourself twisted Thats how youll wind up like spiral stairs I will swear on a

gotta Explain why they call me your ghostwriter Im emptyin my book of rhymes Get em all off my pad every thought that I had I said Im emptyin my book of rhymes Get em all off my pad every thought that I had Havent used all the tricks I have so like my balls its in my bag I tend to get a little testy when Im mad But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks spit your damnedest Youre still gonna hit the canvas Rippin rappers veterans to whippersnappers Mr Mathers is killin this shit villainous wit with scant less Syllables rip the planet biblical shits finna hit the fan Anybody wanna go tit for tats gonna get hit with that Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then Pit it against these pitiful rappers Insidious these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammers Get your whole squad send a task force in If you want it youre bout to get what you asked for then Put your helmet on strap your chin Youre bout to get you a crash course in Who not to start a motherfuckin rap war with Or to go against fuck would you wanna do that for No offense but are you retards slow or dense A fuckin penny has more sense Yeah now you gotta get killed but its not a big deal but every thought is so ill And so methodical thought I swallowed a pill Im starting to feel like Im an automobile With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel Inside a carnival cause Im plowin into everyone who wrote snidey articles And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill Joy and pain fortune fame torture shame choice I made Swore someday the world would pay less to lose more to gain daughters raised Yesterday glory days adored and praised ignored the hate Addressed the fake toured with Dre tore a page from Jordan came Destroyed the game before you came enjoy your stay Before its gone away but the more you claim that youre gonna point and aim If it joined a gang your shit isnt going to bang Youre just boring lame and more of the same You have an enormous chain but a stormless brain The most you can form is rain Your shit is pointless same as a scoreless game So bitch quit lyin youre denyin like Mr Porters name Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller Eyes rollin back in my skull like Eli Porter Fire mortar rounds Ayatollah every iota I load up I owe to my motor mouth This is my note to self Sometimes youre gonna bomb So you just might have to blow yourself up with no ones help I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes Preemo take us out Writin in my book of rhymes My book of rhymes my book of rhymes Im Im Im Im Im Im Im eastside Writin in my book of rhymes My book of rhymes my book of rhymes Im Im Im Im Im Im Im Im Im eastside

Groundhog Day Lyrics What is a nightmare The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare I used to think I had bad luck but I wasnt superstitious Til one day I grew suspicious When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Ednas stoop And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew but ditchin Missouri for Michigan didnt work So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan From Missouri back to Michigan Someone put me out my misery I cant do this again Mom please stick to a decision Discipline last thing I wanna do is listen Shes like Lex Luthor bitchin her rules are Krypton ite So the walls I done lost my power to see through them bitches But I run into em runnin through the kitchen Pretendin to be blind Superman cause I had no supervision But I did have a super power though I could turn into Invisible Kid Disappear out of sight like a true magician And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different Music into the picture and it became my new religion I remember it clearly even today Move back to Michigan again to live with my Grandma Nan Always itchin for somethin to do was flippin Through the radio stations one day And discovered this DJ who was mixin I say it to this day if you aint listened to The Wizard You aint have a fuckin clue what you was missin Id zone out with my headphones All I remember doings wishin for shoes Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch Its all about them new edition Troops You get them LL Cool J coolin system Made that final manoeuvre to Mile and Hoover And somehow I saw my future is in this Thats how I knew my mission Little boom box boomin spittin Practicin numerous writtens When Id sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition I remember Proof would visit Couldnt wait to play him my new shit Hed go cuckoo ballistic go through the roof for his shit Its like we knew the instant We touched a mic that both of us two existed To do this shit never quit too persistent Carved an underground empire Started a group of misfits Proof had a proposition If we all band together there aint no stoppin this shit Come up with aliases bipolar opposites and Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision If you got dissed at the Shop cause if they caught you slippin Theyd take your spot if someone got to rippin You and you forgot your written Opportunity knocks once it aint knockin again It tried ding dong ditchin shit I fuckin got that bitch in A headlock cut off its oxygen Slim Is not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind Now I got a pot to piss in Spot in that top position koppin over the opposition Lookin like a dog thats pissin leg up on the competition Promisin complete dominance Sugar Ray Robinson Im in a league Muhammads in Alis my colleague bombin em Probably end up on top of em Stompin em like Ndamukong Im Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson Flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist You spit a rhyme I spit in a rhymes face So name the time place To battle bitch Im still in that mind state Dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes Cry babies maybe my way that I use words Is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse And the truth hurts shit no wonder youre sore losers Now wheres your poo birds Ooh no more trippin in bird shit Songs of self empowerment surgin Words of encouragement but discouragin The rappers the rap games god But the names not James Todd Im just a wordsmith So let these words lift Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells Since yours aint workin out each verse is More merciless than the first is And you aint got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch To get served bloodthirst revenge of the nerds chka Know too that youll not escape my vengeance But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbos gone Word to Uncle Ron Im turnin into a non humble Don You blonde dumb hoes all I got is dick for you to come blow on So start the show but I need a drum roll fore I go on Better back away from the front row get launched Show you Im bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo On the fuckin Jumbotron Im a juggernaut you do not wanna rumble you bomboclaats Ill leave you stretched out like a fuckin yawn So mow the fuckin lawn your asses are blades of grass And Im fuckin up this whole landscape of rap The G O A T just ate eight acres an eighth of that Was just to make a path And take it straight to your favorite rapper Oh look my notebook looks smoke cooked Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot Charred debris floatin like Oakwood Was burnin return of the no good and I wont quit And the next thing I know Something came crawling up from below Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed And I dont quit wont change Its like a Groundhogs Day So crowd around yall cause you may See if I popped your head Im a monster mutt Ima turn into a monster Im a monster mutt With my dick in your mouth all day Im not so sure I want to know from whence it came But the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed There before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing Embed

You see a flash in the sky its that nigga I When I land you wack niggas die And your casket is your last hit You wack bitch fuckin bastard Back to the hand clappin You die quicker than Darren Wilson

Thats backwards for fuck them damn niggas Buck them damn triggers You charge us bodies fill up them damn Rivers Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive But I only like dead rappers Compare me to the best rappers who died And you rappers I used to look up to I gotta cancel you now Like Simon Cowell I cant let you ex factors survive Nah the times right and they finally limelightin the god of

Budden Jersey City New Jersey Now we can do this a couple of different ways it really depends Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims Or I could tell you why Im hot and disappear like MIMS But the bars there put that on God ask a atheist And if I aint the bomb at least Im in the blast radius Im beating these kids indictment shit I like the terror APB on my actions Im in the viking era Moment of truth I give you facts right now Fuck this cypher my mind aint on rap right now So its fuck metaphors and punches all the witty shit Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip Face says I been stressed I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS Nigga why am I here For the look for the promo Shit that bothered from the start Cause

hearse ready These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready Not a how do I feel not a how do I deal If that s life then nigga how is it real These last couple of days Ive been speaking to my peers Giving them cries for help I guess they need to see the tears But wait wildest part of all of that is Theyll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge But fuck it gotta pardon em shout out to my squad and em House Gang Shady Im gone nigga my job is done Yelawolf Gadsden Alabama My name is Wayne Im from Alabama Heres the back story I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb Im Ive got kids and I just popped pills I dont know which ones which or what its for Safety aint really a habit Ive formed I still smoke to the cigarette butt I still drink till I end up being that klutz Clumsy self destructive dummy Stumbling over my words mumbling Ill probably do it tonight Leave the bar leave the car And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars And dream about that light that leads up to the lord I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard Wake up feeling like half a human Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret For my lack of union between rap you and the rock and roll community But unity between country music and MCs Im claiming immunity Still Im working sawing milling this tree Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne tha god and Lord Jamar thought it would be Wait a minute the lord and the god hate me Jesus Christ I am the white devil Nah Im still working sawing milling this tree Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be Wanna take a tour Lets see Ive got floor to ceiling windows and a cabin style mansion Bucks bears trucks boats tires spares four wheelers Three wheelers two wheelers a drug dealer on call Plaques on the wall racks on the wall for my guns on the wall Lift kits low riders chop shops hi tops low tops cowboy boots Dixie flags American flags Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass CEO Ive got my name on the bathrobe and the flame on the back porch is lit Guess whos coming to dinner Andr and Hank the Third go figure Ive got two stand up jetskis a top pedigree horse just to pet and feed of course Who rides a horse in Nashville I might Ive got bicycles for the kids tricycles for the babies M s bottle rockets bottles in my pocket Moonshine gold watches gold rings All fake no bling dont hate thats my thing Ive got new clothes old clothes vintage tremendous endless style Goodwill loves me Mackle more than you Ive got flat screen TVs with skate videos on repeat All the latest CDs mp s and Beats by Dre Thank you very much Jimmy Iovine for the check Ive got a black woman fine as she can be FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind A a a couple hundreds layin on the counter I dont know where that came from I got artwork from hard work yardworkers for yard work Dont look under the tarp sir Im growin weed for my mama there Ive got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley And I did it my way See hip hop is what you make of it And Im makin a lot of it See thats a quadruple entendre Jay Z eat your heart out Joell Ortiz Brooklyn New York But these cyphers I treat em like they a war dont want no mediators Nah this that grow up in the Ps behavior next door to the greasy neighbors People thank you I do this for all the mean creators I was someone who never needed favors to get where Im at Now they deem me a savior But to be honest I aint feelin like that man I just really like rap Yall lucky trust me Im opposite the hands of Sandusky With the shit that my pen state these rappers cant touch me Ugly Shit you serious Im hideous I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out just who I really is As a younger dude life was somethin rude I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move No rubber groove on my shoes led to fights so suspensions I had in one week yeah that was public school Did I say in Thats funny cause theres of us in the Slaughter Thats a and I learned that in public school too Like whats in between a and and House Gang I spoke to all on call Like I dropped albums and is second from bein done Just need yall to send me verse apiece For this Heatmakerz beat and Brothers Keeper Simple mathematics Im addin up to all these rap addicts I dont like to divide dough so I multiply flow And subtract maggots Like a brand new Craftmatic boy Im back at it Smokin these new boys like my last habit Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kicks like the last dragon Hoes suckin my drummer dick they on my bandwagon I just gotta laugh cause yall pushin a lot of swag Im pushin this big ole Hearse dont get body bagged Royce Da Detroit gah These new rappers be askin me Why I dont be hangin out where they be hangin out I tell em I say Lil nigga listen here If I dont got no business there I dont got no business there See theres a difference here You hustlin so you can be seen Nigga Im grindin so I can disappear I dont do it like other rappers do When its on time its skull and bone signs at the stu We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin out Like Chico Bean When theres drama I dont ask no questions I just clap in that direction I look at this gat like its a actual accessory Im anti social so relax when you step to me Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry Your lil stare downs wont fare well I got a pale conscience Im the grey area The last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman Now imagine me hangin with yall and we rappin on the same song Nigga Id rather juggle a couple of chainsaws Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on Im a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit The only celebrity who give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch Glock in the stash as a backup but the MACll burst Cripple your style your first born childll come out With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth I dont give a fuck Nigga Ill show up to Beyonces show posin as Jay Z Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest Lookin like Omarion holdin his baby Jump in the door Mercedes with a listenin to JoJo and K Ci Drinkin and sniffin enough blow that it got me thinkin I can exchange sicknesses Maybe this ebola for rabies Thats it just livin the rapper life Banana clip in the air lookin like its bout to start singin its MAC tonight MACs I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin up I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner Cause shit can turn into that song except I dont give a fuck what day it is Ill have this club goin up fuck with me Mack magnet attractin enormous green Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack Cause this bitch is that war machine Life of a giant but who needs size when youre wack and your teams soft Drag your girl down this hill til she admits that it feels like shes jackin the beanstalk We both got marketing plans Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me And then go and invest into a grocery store Rolled up with the Smith Wesson and drew on you like lets fight now I do numbers I turn you and your crew into two plumbers Translation get your shit together and pipe down Fuck a mic I dont write I chew and spit Ill shoot you and your sis if you insist I got my eyes on the sparrow Silencers so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel And he doin this My name is Marshall Im reppin that motherfuckin Motor City bitch I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet Began to trend set murdered a friends pet Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet Im already covered in sweat and I wasnt even ready to come in yet AHH let me set this drink down Beat up a gal start beef with her pal Probably be wild til Im wrinkled and senile And Rap God was a freestyle Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch And Im freestyling now I need a towel sweat leaks from my brow Its burning my eyes my cerebral is foul Cause shit Im thinking about should be illegal I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio And went to South Beach with his talents Scream fuck you on the way out and wink with a smile This whole game can eat a dick Im going back deep underground But right now Im back on that bullshit and you Im singling out Cause youre so fucking outdated you should mingle a while What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters Bunch of Buster Douglas motherfuckers is one hit wonders One swing and youre crowned Knocked one out the park one catchy jingle and now You think you fucking with me cause you sold like thou Bitch I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground Reach up swing from a cloud with thousand people around Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd And heave a child in a sinkhole on Cinco de Mayo When Im sprinkled in pico de gallo Mardi Gras beads in a towel I just made that up I dont know much Spanish Im not bilingual But Ill show you a Mexican stand off Between just these two amigos Cause neither really wants to say what were thinking out loud But I sure as fuck think I know how to read body English no doubt Cause were trying to kill each other but lyrically The fuck is humility What is a real emcee Royce he came up in this shit with me Never spit that hustler shit it wasnt a fit for me Let them adjust til they just get the gist of me Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history Of muscular distrophy it wasnt a mystery Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning So what in the fuck is a list to me Im used to not being on it I expect it out em Heck wit em I get my respect without em Aint really been into diamonds since I put my first record out But I could put a chain around my second album And wear it as a neck medallion Became a millionaire went downhill from there Became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career The fuck am I gonna do until then This job is too fulfilling Two ga jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in A mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville Into some children at the food pavilion at Build A Bear Warriors mind I m pro hydrocodone euphoria In the Drug Emporium line Im soaring Im pouring Vicodin four at a time ignoring the warning signs on em fore I go four wheeler riding Gory and violent horrifying You surely wont find no one more abhorring Than I am with this retaliatory of rhyming for Gloria Steinem But I finger her like a witness show me a line up I usually am abusive but excuse me maam I guess I mustve threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam When I said I could use the sample cause yous a tramp But look how you react to this trigger like When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam Youre playing right into Lex Luthors hand Its such a ruthless plan might even lose a fan But fuck it Superman wouldnt change in a phone booth for Stan Im a brand new being like Grand Pubas band Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed In his pooper with lubricant wait thats too I cant Since honesty is the best policy Ill give you the old college try Try to acknowledge my mistakes probably wont qualify As a gentleman and a scholar but its time that I swallow pride And say that Im sorry sorry I cant apologize I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughters minds Then Im like dollar signs But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice Play nice bitch Ill punch Lana Del Rey right In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight In plain sight of the elevator surveillance Til her head is banged on the railing Then celebrate with the Ravens Never date an assailant who self medicates with inhalants Id meditate but I may need a better way to escape The aggression rage and the anger Cause leg restraints on the ankles Heavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains Just aint enough to contain it But Id still get the same respect as Jay if I came on Stage in a fucking neglig e everyday and Liz Claiborne Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson Wait slut your friends what are they gonna say Cause makeup aint gonna cover That eye thats seven eighths of the way shut Peppersprayed with your face cut Made my bank like a lay up Off these effing skanks on the way up Oh bitch thinks shes heaven sent Its evident that she aint never been with seven inches Yes I said seven I measured it Seven inches from the floor While Im standing on the fourth floor balcony At the Sheraton while Im stretching it Bitch Im a pimp so a limp dick is all youll ever get So if shes hesitant to get the hint Ill bet you that I get the message sent who shes messing with Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench Existential detriment to a lesbian devil And the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level A separatist like a Chechnian rebel Impressionist with a pencil A pessimist with his lips pressed against The edge of this Red Bull Pedal to the metal Im rippin this shit cause right away Ill give it to a bitch like a pedestrian deadly as ever You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass SHADYXV as perplexing as The last fifteen years and Im predicting my next relapse When I spit these lyrics so dont look at me weird When I start shifting gears and shit re smears all over Britney Spears And these little Disney queers Who use chicks for beards Just made that up too Oh and the Shady We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls Cause its supposed to confuse you hoes So flows lose you as usual so juvenile year old when I go to the studio Its only music but dont be foolish though You dont know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though In my homies Buick Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it When I step in the vocal booth like Im supposed to do And murder you on a fuckin track like Tony Stewart In one take if I fuck up and I dont redo it You couldnt sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it The day I dont say fuck you all you can throw me through it Rootinest tootinest shootin this from the hip With the sentiments Eminem isnt penning them for the women Im an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia They tryna get rid of me gadzooks But I stiggity stand

Tragic Endings Lyrics Im stumbling I can t see straight And its my fault I got this way I got my hands on something great And found a way to mess it up I did my best I tried to change But its just in my DNA I got my hands on something great And found a way to fuck it up again Now I m the one thing You couldnt hate more But youre the one thing That I would die for All my life I was told I was never nothing special I dont need to be reminded of it every other second Specially when all my self esteems Already shot to hell Im falling helplessly Im embarrassed I don t want no one else to see Cause I feel like Im a piece of shit every time she yells at me Selfishly addicted definitely doesn t help that she Makes me feel like Ive died and gone to heaven But makes life a living hell for me She does that thing with her lip now shes melting me Im putty in her palms I m wrapped around her finger A yo yo on a string she lets me sit there and just dangle Until something better comes along And shell just drop me like a hot potato I look like Im in pain but Im okay though Cause I know she loves me my friends what do they know Its like Im drowning at sea Hoping that you reach for me I know youre there but I cant see Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings Im dying to breathe And all you do is strangle me Such a beautiful relief Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings In my moments of weakness I openly admit the shit I wouldnt normally Im extremely self conscious and enormously Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she Gets goin she dont stop when Im up shes like a downer When I found her it was love at first encounter But somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for Me to walk on when Im around her But theres just something about her That makes me not able to function without her How can I get out of it when I dont know how to Im a doubter Im a pessimist make a believer out of me And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain Cause Im going straight down the drain Im drowning Its like Im drowning at sea Hoping that you reach for me I know youre there but I cant see Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings Im dying to breathe And all you do is strangle me Such a beautiful relief Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings Now Im the one thing You couldnt hate more But youre the one thing That I would die for It took a while for me to get it but I think Ive figured it out She dont want me she just dont wanna see me with someone else The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say Screw her I threw up on myself Im dumb sick Im addicted to her Shes tryna block the door so heres how I do her Since Im manure shes a sewer And this time this piece of shits running through her I can see the light now Im running to it What the fuck Shoulda knew it Who would think shed actually have the balls to do it As soon as I hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid Shes standing there with a rag bout to put the lighter to it Lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it Its like Im drowning at sea Hoping that you reach for me I know youre there but I cant see Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings Im dying to breathe And all you do is strangle me Such a beautiful relief Cause Im so drunk off tragic endings Embed

Yellow Brick Road Lyrics What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you will to be saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children We seem to be approaching an age of the gross We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station and each and each generation should do a little bit better All right come on lets cut the bullshit enough Lets get it started lets start addressin this issue and open it up Lets take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss Statements thats made on this tape and its whole origin of The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy The music you accuse me of tryin to destroy Lets rewind it to when I was a boy On the East Side of Detroit crossin Mile into Warren Into hick territory Id like to share a story This is my story and cant nobody tell it for me You have well informed me I am well aware That I dont belong here youve made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From Bel Aire shopping center just for stoppin in there From the black side all the way to the white side Okay theres a bright side a day that I might slide You may call it a pass I call it haulin my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so well known tracks So lets go back follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on lets go back follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Id roam the streets so much they called me a drifter Sometimes Id stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike From somebodys backyard and drop it off at the park That was the halfway mark to meet Kim had to walk Back to her mamas on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when Im kicked out my moms Thats about the time I first met Proof With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn handin out some flyers We was doin some talent shows at Center Line High I told him to stop by and check us out sometime He looked at me like Im out my mind Shook his head like White boys dont know how to rhyme I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit Where compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride Somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line So lets go back follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on lets go back follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home My first year in th grade cant forget that day at school It was cool til your man MC Shan came through He said that Pumas the brand cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors but man goddamn they flew Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes I had the new ones the Cool J Ice Lamb suede too But we just threw em in the trash like they yesterdays news Guess who came through next X Clan debuted Professor X Exist in a state of red black and green with a key sissies Now with

Butter would go to the mall With em all over our necks like were showin em off Not knowin at all we was bein laughed at You aint even half black You aint posed to have that homie let me grab that And that Flavor Flav clock we gon have to snatch that All I remember is meetin back at Manixs basement sayin how we hate this How racist but dope the X Clans tape is Which reminds me back in me And Kim broke up for the first time she was tryin to two time me And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool Cause I rapped so she was kinda eyein me And oh the irony guess what her name was Aint even gonna say it plus The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts And a pair of jugs the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school If I could pull her not only would I become more popular But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy And thats the last I ever seen or heard Or spoke to the Ole Foolish Pride girl but Ive heard People say they heard the tape and it aint that bad But it was I singled out a whole race And for that I apologize I was wrong Cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a So lets go back follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on

Bad Meets Evil Lyrics I reckon you aint familiar with these here parts You know theres a story behind that there saloon years ago two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldnt stop em Quickest damn gun slingers Ive ever seen Got murdered in cold blood That old saloon there was their little home away from home They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night you can still hear The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da I dont speak I float in the air wrapped in a sheet Im not a real person Im a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And the noise is spread Picked up and transmitted through Royces head Trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side He made a choice and said Who hard Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which onell swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil intelligence level Is hellier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal Im not a fair man disgraced the race of an atheist Interceptin missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over worked its like the Nazis and the Nation Collaboratin attemptin to take over the Earth Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil We hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I dont agree with police either Shit me neither We aint eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasin rage on anybody in squeezin range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin rain No Im not I just want to shoot up And Im pissed off cause I cant find a decent vein The disaster with dreads Im bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after Im dead When in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred man until they joint chains While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass Im blazin emcees at the same time amazin emcees Somehow emcees aint that eyebrow raisin to me From all of angles of us flash a MAC loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust til volcanoes erupt Hello Ayo what s up Stop they know its us I used to be a loudmouth remember me Im the one who burned your house down Well Im out now And this time Im comin back to blow your house up And I aint gon leave you with a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you wont see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and Im gettin ready to leave Ima put air in a bag and charge people to breathe Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful see you in Hell for the sequel See you in Hell Wall Street Royce Da Slim Shady See you in Hell for the sequel Bad Meets Evil what And so thats the story of when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law abiding citizens Its too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back comin out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on til this day Shh wait did yall hear that Embed
Rabbit Run Lyrics Some days I just wanna up and call it quits I feel like Im surrounded by a wall of bricks Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits My lifes like one great big ball of shit If I could just put it all into all I spit Stead of always tryna swallow it Instead of starin at this wall and shit While I sit writers block sick of all this shit Cant call it shit all I know is Im about to hit the wall If I have to see another one of Moms alcoholic fits This is it last straw thats all thats it I aint dealin with another fuckin politic Im like a skillet bubblin until it filters up Im about to kill it I can feel it buildin up Blow this building up Ive concealed enough My cup runneth over I done filled it up The pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts Well Ima show you what you gon feel my rush You dont feel it then it must be too real to touch Peel the Dutch Im about to tear shit up Goosebumps yeah Ima make your hair sit up Yeah sit up Ima tell you who I be Ima make you hate me cause you aint me You wait it aint too late to finally see What you closed minded fucks were too blind to see Whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee Out this world aint no one out their mind as me You need peace of mind Heres a piece of mine All I needs a line But sometimes I dont always find the words to rhyme To express how Im really feelin at that time Yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes Its just sometimes its always me How dark can these hallways be The clock strikes midnight one two then half past three This half assed rhyme with this half assed piece Of paper Im desperate at my desk If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again Stuck in a slump cant think of nothin Fuck Im stumped up oh wait here comes somethin Nope its not good enough scribble it out New pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out Im fizzlin now thought I figured it out Balls in my court but Im scared to dribble it out Im afraid but why am I afraid Why am I a slave to this trade Cyanide I spit to the grave Real enough to rile you up Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want Im a switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith aint a quitter Ima sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a Fuckin boiling point put some oil in your joints Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed An MCs worst dream I make em tense They hate me see me and shake like a chain link fence By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was comin By the screams of em you would swear Im sawin someone By the way theyre runnin you would swear the law was comin Its now or never and tonight is all or nothin Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us He said hed be back he pinky promised I dont think hes honest Ill be back baby I just gotta beat this clock Fuck this clock Ima make em eat this watch Dont believe me Watch Ima win this race And Ima come back and rub my shit in your face Bitch I found my niche you gon hear my voice Til youre sick of it you aint gonna have a choice If I gotta scream til I have half a lung If I have half a chance Ill grab it Rabbit run Embed
On Fire Lyrics You know critics man Critics never got nothin nice to say man You know the one thing I notice about critics man Is critics never ask me how my day went Well Ima tell em Augh yesterday my dog died I hog tied a ho tied her in a bow Said Next time you blog try to spit a flow You wanna criticize dog Try a little mo Im so tired of this I could blow fire in the hole Im fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro Better hold on a little tighter here I go Flows tighter hot headed as Ghost Rider Cold hearted as Spider Man throwing a spider in the snow So you better get lower than Flo Rida Inside of a lowrider with no tires in a hole Why am I like this Why is winter cold Why is it when I talk Im so biased to the hoes Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets This isnt golf this is a blistering assault Those are your wounds this is the salt so get lost Shit dissin me is just like pissin off the Wizard of Oz Wrap a lizard in gauze Beat you in the jaws with it grab the scissors and saws And cut out your livers gizzards and balls Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers Tickle him go to his grave skip him and visit his dog Thats how you know youre on a roll Cause when youre hot its like youre burning up everyone elses cold Man Im so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit You need to stop drop and roll Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow Yeah Yuh I just put a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses If you mistook this for a song look this aint a song Its a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook That the crook just took over so book Run as fast as you can stop writing and kill it Im lightning in a skillet youre a fuckin flash in the pan I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan Mr Mathers is the man yeah Im pissed But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can Come back and whip your ass with it again Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand Itll eat through anything metal the ass of Iron Man Turn him into plastic So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is asinine Yeah ask Denaun man Hit a blind man with a coloring book And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon Fuck it I aint playin pull up in a van And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin Vietnam vet Im out my fuckin mind man Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him nine grand So if I seem a little mean to you This aint savage you aint never seen a brute You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route You couldnt make a bulimic puke On a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop Sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care And why the fuck am I yellin at air I aint even talkin to no one cause aint nobody there And nobody will fuckin test me Cause these hoes wont even dare Im wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here Nah dont waste it save it psycho yeah Plus you got to rewrite those lines That you said about Michaels hair Thats how you know youre on a roll Cause when youre hot its like youre burning up everyone elses cold Man Im so Im so hot My motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie You need to stop drop and roll Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow Yeah Oh shit Embed

Bully Lyrics Yo check it out Its fucked up Cause I dont see either one of us budging Im withholdin my anger though Id like to be the strangler Of this punk ass little pussys puny neck Its my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence But he just displays complete lack of respect Thats what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me As he sits with both his feet up at his desk Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin things And he just cant see that hes manically depressed And in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy As he turns on MTV and sees my face He dont exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls Spirals and spins til he hurls himself into a rage And its destroyin him slowly cause he does not even know me Even though he sees me everywhere he goes So he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth So he extorts someone else to get his dough And now hes actin like a bully so he tries to push and pull me But he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me Cause it annoys him to see that I aint scared You aint no motherfuckin bully And I aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully I wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully And I know it must be fuckin wit you emotionally Now Im not tryin to make no more enemies no more unfortunately Theres so many other motherfuckers there just are They just keep houndin at me now that Im down with Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja But his ass is such a puppet Irv could shove his whole hand up it And just make him say what he wants him to say But Suge has Irv on a string and Irvs so nervous that he Says anything to this man to keep him at bay So now Ja thinks that hes so tough and Murder Inc s the big bad wolf And they go huff and puff and blow our label down But our buildings made out of bricks so you aint takin out shit And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard Cause you know we dont play that black and white shit Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch You aint no motherfuckin bully And I aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully I wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully You must be takin too much E Now what bothers me the most about hip hop is were so close To pickin up where we left off with Big and Pac We just lost Jam Master J Big L got blasted away Plus we lost Bugz Slang Ton and Freaky Tah Its like a never ending cycle that just seems to come full circle Everybodys gotta be so fuckin hard And Im not excludin myself cause I been stupid as well I been known to lose it when someone says something smart But as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes Its no exception it goes for every man But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs But he just keeps feedin him pills so if that E doesnt kill him Someone from G Unit will and I aint buzzed Dawg Im talkin to you straight if the situation escalates Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game And if I get killed for this rap I got a million in cash That says I will get you back in Hailies name You aint no motherfuckin bully And I aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully I wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully Irvine get your boy off of that E Get at me dawg Holla Embed

Fine Line Lyrics Another day another hotel the inside of it is nice though oh well This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonights show To see how far that line goes still blows my mind show business Guess Ill just never get so this shit just always feels so weird To this day because alls I ever did Was just say the shit I wouldve wanted to hear Other people say to me when I was a kid So please dont make me some type of hero Cause I will say some ol inspirational shit in a real way But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit In the world and tell it to suck on the dick cause I still make fun Of a sitch someones in like a son of a bitch at anothers expense Im fuckin relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen I struggle with coming to senses stuck on the fence Its a balance beam if I seem unbalanced its challenging When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest Childish things without even blinking without even thinkin about All the stinkin amounts of people that seems to be reachin But the crowds theyre screaming And The Palace sold out this evening But now its lay me down to sleep And is it really my soul to keep or have I sold it cheap Is it greed And do I take more than I need When I joke of leavin but keep overachievin Cause what its stole from me Ive barely broken even I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need So a martyr is how I paint myself And through my harrowin ordeals I m so vain I want my respect But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect Til I sit in the dark and I reflect And my reflection shows what its like here Cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights Yeah its like a nightmare I said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror And I dont like how I see myself so I open the Bible to Isaiah Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears Cause this ice layer I skate ons a nice way of putting it But I like stayin feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player I got a nice paradise here sealed off in my lair Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from And this house is quite bare but it aint when you cant leave it And I feel so isolated its nice I made it But its like I paid the price of fame twice I hate it So I bitch about my life then make another song Vicious cycle aint it then wonder why I stay famous I keep walkin the line this goldfish bowl gets old But especially when you don t know If your conscience is sayin I told you so Cause you dont even know anymore If you got the soul of a soldier or you sold your soul I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need And from here you look so small Hovering high above us all Please come back to me I still remember the times when They were simpler than the rhymes of Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin the mics Ill never forget what that feeling was like I miss those times now when I was just starting out Without a dime and now Im diamond I cant even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when Ive been Stuck in this house hibernatin hate even going outside It sucks sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse I dont even want to buy nothin I just wanna fuckin walk around inside it Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin bout life and Everything about it I miss which now reminds me Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz Wow I must have had Alzheimers Long time since I shouted them out bout time Cause its been on my mind lately how Zee you always supported me You vouched I will never forget that and How you guys accepted me for me and Pace I love you too you slept on my couch And Ive been thinkin bout the time When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse Rhymings all we ever wanted to do And regardless how life has turned out Inside Ill Ill always be an outsider My life has been turned inside out but I I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need I know its a fine fine line Living in hope or dire need But I keep walkin the line Embed

Crazy In Love Lyrics Tell myself that I was doing alright Theres nothing left to do tonight But go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy crazy on you oh Cant you see what you do to me baby You make me crazy you make me act like a maniac Im like a lunatic you make me sick Youre truly the only one who can do this to me You just make me get so crazy I go schizo I get so insane I just go schizophrenic One minute I wanna slit your throat the next I wanna sex You make me crazy the way we act Like two maniacs in the sack We fuck like two jackrabbits And maybe thats a bad habit Cause the next day were right back at it In the same exact pattern What the fuck is the matter with us We cant figure out if its lust or its love Whats that thats attractin us to each other They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother Which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch But I stay and still stick it out with you Even though I just hit you today But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you Just cause I came home late last night Crawled in bed and I woke you But if theres one thing about you that I admire its baby Because you stay with me maybe cause youre as crazy as I am Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side Like a devil in disguise youre always full of surprises Always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore Youre only but youre plenty more ma ture Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls Like theyre in middle school still Youre crazy sexy cool chill And you play your position you never step outta line Even though I stay in your business youve always kept outta mine I wonder whats on your mind Sometimes they say love is blind Maybe thats why the first time I dotted your eye you aint see the sign Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved Maybe cause were crazy in love Go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy crazy on you oh You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad The moral the very fiber the whole substance to my rap You are my reason for being the meaning of my existence If it wasnt for you I would never be able to spit this As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire Youre my entire supply gas the match and igniter The only way that I am able to stay so stable Is youre the legs to my table If you were to break Id fall on my face But Im always gonna make you feel I dont need you as much As I really need you so you dont use it to your advantage But youre essential to me youre the air I breathe I believe If you ever leave me Id probably have no reason to be You are the Kim to my Marshall youre the Slim to my Shady The Dre to my Eminem the Alaina to my Hailie You are the word that Im lookin for When Im tryin to describe how I feel inside And the right one just wont come to my mind Youre like the pillar that props me up the beam that supports me The bitch who never took half the wife who never divorced me Youre like the root to my evil you let my devil come out me You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me And no matter how much too much is never enough Maybe cause were crazy in love Go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy crazy on you oh Embed
Spend Some Time Lyrics If theres any bitches in this room Then theres somethin I gotta say For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way Ive been down that road And now Im back sittin on square one Tryin to pick myself up where I started from I never woulda thought that Id see you out of control Even though my penis was deep down in your hole You should know between us we was like mates of soul Nothin could intervene us especially no hoes You was more so the chalant type I chose Til more shows haunted you nights I suppose Thats how it go with time spent emotion grows In the beginning friends we decided to roll So whos responsible when you get excited explode And Obies grinnin then you invite that Obies cold But bitches they gon talk niggas they gon hate We established this way before we became mates So whats required is that you chill with all that fire Get your desire when I retire and Spend some time with me say that youll be mine I never thought Id find someone to be mine Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line Spend some time with me say that youll be mine I used to say I never met a girl like you before Still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are Almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters Til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for Cant believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off It was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on You started gettin moody on me pretty soon wed argue And the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me And whoda even knew that Who woulda even thought possibly Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me Its true that I got shot in the heart But when someone seems too good to be true they usually are But see when youre in it its too hard to see Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat Before you make a decision thats life altering And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave You hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring Spend some time with me say that youll be mine I never thought Id find someone to be mine Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line Spend some time with me say that youll be mine Ha ha yeah right bitch Spend some time on my dick In most cases Stats attitude is Fuck a bitch My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch But you was different thought we shared a covenant Even held your hand in pub a lic We sufferin because of this Shawty on some whole nother other shit Tryin to play slick thinkin Ima trick off grip Ill admit I was caught in the mix down to commit Feedin you the best of me I shouldve fed you piss We started off closer than close But who couldve predicted to know Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth And the final result back in that same boat I asked myself Do I love these hoes Nope Em introduced us this is Tanya Tanya this is Then slid off and left her to kick it with me I complimented her I said You have very nice lips With my imagination I could see her suckin my dick We played the phone game a week later shit changed fast Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline Penthouse full of imported shit you know how I grind She got to talkin talkin like an opportunist too Why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move Said shes an aspiring actress she do videos for practice Yeah yeah know how many times I done heard that shit Spend some time with me say that youll be mine I never thought Id find someone to be mine Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line Spend some time with me say that youll be mine Embed

Don t Front Lyrics Used to get bent now I represent to the fullest Pencil is full of insolent bullets Im like a Doberman Pinscher Pitbull and a Rott Mixed with a toxic the plot begins to thicken I begin to spittin like vintage Pac Demented demonic sinister Ever since the Doc replenished me The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit So to not see him with me would be a shockin image And Im the definition of what a concrete chin is Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it And knock me to the canvas even the boxin critics Know that if I get off to a rocky start Ill always have a Rocky finish Eat me broccoli spinach cocky Nope But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at This and put emphasis on the dope So when names come up in that conversation of whos the dopest better throw mine in it And dont mind me while I remind you of the flow You wont find anywhere When it fires and I unload my pen explodes Til theres no rhymes in it reload in no time Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by so you know I meant it In school I was so shy timid Two pairs of jeans Id alternate bummy clothes I member Beggin my mom for K Mart MacGregors Cause those were new St Vincent de Paul Those Ponys were used and no size fitted But kissed them old days adi s I did it They said I was a gimmick Now Im the one that those guys mimic Now you fuckers dont wanna go startin no argument Cause you know Ill win it Name a flow thats more authentic and dont front Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open word Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open kid Yo why you frontin You know I got you open kid Rest in peace to Big Proof You was a beast you lyrically mirrored me Molded my flow off of you your spirits flowin through me I love you Doody without you I feel so incomplete Im no king no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet Im a thorn in your side get thrown into a throne Better watch the fuckin tone that you speak Feel like Im in the zone Im in a whole different league On my motherfuckin own its just me No opponents can compete And Ive never been known to retreat From beef be beat follow trends or wallow in defeat Im still hungry as fuck but cant even say Bon app tit Cause I dont know what to eat Fuckin microphone or the beat Bitch nobodys mind works like mine Its nose to the grindstone time holmes your minds blown Cause I rhyme like Im still tryna get signed Up in the Ebony Show case With Denaun screamin Who the fuck passed you the mic Never asked you to like my shit from the get Id rather ask you to wipe my ass bitch You had you a nice run now take a hike I ever meet my match Ima strike that bitch first Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers The real rappers get their mothafuckin skills crackin Word to Buckshot and Dru Ha why the fuck not You dont like it Suck a cock almost forgot Before I signed with the Doc I almost signed with Duck Down Cause Rawkus didnt make no offers so mothafuck Loud They jerked me around so whats up now Wow how much of an asshole would I sound like Rubbin it in and holdin some grudge now But dont front Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you know I got you open kid Dont front you

You know I got you open kid Late at night used to catch a buzz couldnt write Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak Im on a streak windshield wipers couldnt wipe Its hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight Cause Im hyper or somethin Needin someone or somethin is lightin This fire under me its breathin new life Its like I already died once I guess some people only live twice and its funny My days of being broke were so long ago I lost all concept of money But you dimes wont get a fuckin nickle from me Oh shit Im down on one knee Im havin a stroke of genius Elizabeth Im comin to you honey From boy to man And still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland Im in another category man Dont group me up with them pop stars I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy band No offense Yes offense Precedents has been set thatll never get met Middle finger pressed against Mobys nose Shouts to Obie the curtains closed on my show But never forget that Im the one you thought wouldnt make it You cant take it oh Got a whole generation of rappers comin up That are nutty with the flow but convince me youve heard An MC since me whos as good with the fuckin mincing of words Without mincing words thatll make you feel like Im pinching a nerve Whos as mentally disturbed You might as well stick a knife in me and turn Itll be like my skin bein Indian burned hah Bitch there isnt one when will you learn Never been served if memory serves Id battle that til my own recollection remembers these words You know I got you open kid dont stop frontin You know I got you open Word Life Embed

Kick Off Lyrics Ive always looked at battle rap as competition or war and the main objective is to destroy completely fuckin obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything whatever the fuck you can to get a reaction from the crowd So nothings off limits I need you to spit that lyrical miracle in the swimming pool Before this kicks off let me set my balls on this tees Cause I m dottin is every time I cross one of these Theres not a redeeming quality at all in me Its impossible seems like an implausible dream Positive clean thoughts intervene But theyre all either altered and mean Assault and demean tossed and theyre being lost in the scheme Squashed in between a brainwashing machine Like an Islamic regime a jihadist extreme radical Suicide bomber thats seeing Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region I m not gonna finish that for obvious reasons But bring your dogs I ma muzzle em I m not Middle Eastern but Ill make a bitch rock a hijab And at least a extra large in a T shirt Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet hasta la vista I go Hamas on the beats a paradox on the beach And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list Gettin head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich Professional shit sprayer Bitch watch who you talkin to like Apple wristwear Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce Prey s decreasing I face extinction like disc players Told this chick shes hot as Jada Pinkett And just stared til I made her think it Said Maybe we should just get married Shes facing me I placed my feet with my hips square Tell her Turn around spread her legs for me then I hit bare Leave her stretched out like a baby T shirt on Ric Flair As I rip tear anal beads in a split rear Spray Febreze in the chicks hair Make her wheeze tryna get air I played for keeps theres no escaping me I have a bitch scared And chained to me and throw away the key And shell be so afraid to leave That even if she ends up breaking free shell just sit there Tryin to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up Its impossible like rapin a slut We stay butt naked and fuck Youre close wait for you what My idea you comin too is waking you up With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup Thatll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup Hate to get bogged down in details But bitch Im like the dog pound with females My brain is corrupt real life Hillside Strangler I strangle a skanks neck til its triangular Shaped but its upside down and my mouth aint gonna shut And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck Or helps you rake in the ducats I want payment in pub Cause I aint tryna get in your bars like Im waiting the club But if you put me in your lines Im takin a cut Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit Every punchline every combination that rhymes with it Bitch a whole team cant see me theres no Is in it Head so big I shot myself ten times in it Tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes And I survived this shit Someones gonna challenge me who Battle me and win thats a fucking fallacy too You name one motherfucker in this galaxy spits reality You fantasy rally your troops try to boost the morale Only time I start a movements a bowel I cant even give a yeah or a woo when you rap in the booth Not even a nah or a boo Cause even though Im allergic to the crap that you spew When Im bout to break out I dont mean get a rash from it too Cause when I say I have allergies I actually do But thats just an analogy Ive never had a reaction to you Creature from the Black Lagoon I reach up and I smack the moon Youre grief struck that Im back so soon Your teacher for this afternoon Creep up with a pack of hoodlums We pack a punch like Caprisun Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub machine gun We stuck in a submarine bun with a bag of shrooms Cup of lean up in the padded room Justin Bieber in a Catholic school Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him Dont adjust your speaker Ill cuss the stripes off of a fuckin zebra when Im at the zoo Huffin cleaner til I gag from fumes Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon While I bump some G Funk and blast some Snoop Cause her double G cups are massive huge Its fun for me just to grab a boob Plus my penis got an attitude My fuckin wieners in a combative mood Come and suck a mean one like its mad at you I speak tongue in cheek what you asslicks do Cause you love to eat butt its sad but true I just sprung a leak suddenly What I think in my gut instinct become in sync My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other Ink touches the pad then boom Since the day Dre gave me beats I was made elite Thats basically what makes me me Creating stink til these tats are fading ink Whos the greatest Think were still debating wink ADD and better put out an APB Cause itll take LAPD and me layin in the street For you to see Shady beat And Ill bet ya theyd need cleats Cause Id have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat I pray please Jesus to make me decent Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers and saline I take three Aleves tryna break these fevers Im ailing I stay free of divas and ladies screamin Cause they keep schemin on me Vading keepin the women at bay Like Laci Peterson baby fetuses Legs and feet have been weighted chained in semen Its straight demon and wait Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers Mistake free schemes are enablin me to remain deviant Breakbeat eat her like steak meat Emcees take seats like AMC theaters Deranged ringleader depraved king Who mainstream media hates Which makes things easier still under scrutiny Villainous smooth criminal livin room With the nude Reese Witherspoon Who was bruised beat with a broom Its in two pieces and lays deceased in it Pit with a chewed leash and his chain link leapin it Live in the booth shave eat bathe drink sleep in it R A P bleed the shit still and I poop pee it Its a spillage a sewage leak waist deep feces The syllables ooze fecal they feel like renewed leases Cause my brain releases em Like waste excretion its simultaneously As Im givin these fools grief theyre feelin the blues Cause even if stealin my shoes thieves Just to fill ems a huge feat A hill and its too steep Obey these demons were still in cahoots Keep feedin me blank sheets As soon as I sank these teeth And Im killin the loose leaf Time to shake these trees again Wait make that phrase repeat again Killin the loose leaf shake these trees again Get the rake but it aint me leavin em Vicodins Nuprins I bite them and chew them The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons And I like to sniff gluesticks put Ricin on toothpicks On the mic Im just ruthless a crisis a nuisance Who I influence I give two shits If they wanna license my music to entice with Then use the shit like its the blueprint for ISIS recruitment Excuse me while I stare into space for a few In a daze or a haze glazed over crazed warped loon Mental cased off always had a straight forward view But you bozos keep givin the flamethrower fuel No ones ever sank lower shrewd and way more rude Beast mode like a lawn mower blade rolled through it And this has little to do with bein gay boy Its just where the wordplays goin But aint much I can say or do Cause aint no excuse the way I go at you censored You say Im always screw faced So if I look your way youre screwed Cause if looks could kill I could start a hate war too Cause Id murder you straight bitches by turnin the gaze on you Lets take it back before the tightly worn pants To the Nike Jordan hats The stripe Lees Jordache and the white tees Lightning storms might be formed fast Such a frightening forecast But when youre slightly hoarse rasp From the cyphering or gasp but still reciting your raps While youre tightening your grasp around the mic cause you done shitted on it so much youre always reminded of your past Cause your heinys sore thats Cause you still havent finished fuckin wiping your ass From the night before last No good but raps somethin Im too good for my own good at Fuck adulthood Im a grown up brat Where your cojones at Mine are always being rode in fact Theyre frozen you ever seen a cul de sac So big they fell out my scrotum I just sewed em back Dick so long need a shoulder strap For that gotta unroll it and fold it back So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic it overlaps it So I pack a Trojan so fat when I lay it flat its like a yoga mat Make a bitch think shes in aerobics class The bear you dont wanna poke is back The backbone of rap your fuckin lead singles are my bonus tracks When I appear my peers stop Hearts fall in their stomach their spirits drop Careers flop their gears lock severe shock Fear at the mere thought Lyrics are top tier Im so high at the top Im in the sky when I talk Bitch Im so fly when I walk my ears pop Oh and Im just playin ladies you know I love you I got a idea for a line Embed

All I Think About Lyrics From the moment I go to bed til I wake up All day this is all I can think about baby So I go straight at opponents heads with this anger Always cause this is all I can think about baby The chopper got about fifty bullets Aint no way its accidental when I spill em on you Im the realest in the biz how you livin Cause you can get it how you live And while you livin Imma say my pull out game is so real I still get rid of kids now thats ill The top of your head can fly off the top of convertibles Aint gon really take no time to come through and murder you I dont fake mine I do this the fair way Snitches get stitches blown away and left on display Hung by the grapevine I just kicked a chair away Let me be the first to tell you that you lookin at a superstar My microphone and AK thats my new guitar I dont belong to you and I dont care who you are Yeah you sold a couple records got a couple joints Got a few Jordans three four pairs of Louboutins Thats besides the point like a shootin guard Nigga Im a rockstar With whoopin cough I am sick George Clooney wit a Uzi What kind of a movie star Would hop out a movin car just to prove he s hard Fuck you doin you retard Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shootin dog You swear I knew where the Roofies are The way I drug a bitch through the yard Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin her nude and newly scarred Body in waterproof tarp covered in roofin tar So what you so blunt for Did you fuckin fall off chump Or did you jump Or did you just become bored with this You re slipping into a funk I just become morbid And more self absorbed in my own world everyone orbits Pen at the table I don t know when I ll be able to stop Told you from the gate One thought it generally takes and I m off to the races Wait mentally stable hold your fuckin horses There s nothin more disgustin an animal I just got done snortin the fuckin bathroom soap And the tannin lotion To unwarp this mind you gon need some sort of an antidote There s not a pill for bananas though It s unfortunate you got delusions of grandeur though Actin like you re Michelangelo with a fuckin cordless Bitch Im Shredder so you better crawl back in your shell Or run fore you get injured A fuckin Ninja Turtle wouldn t come toward us Two joint forces of course this is what blunt force is Cause we d smoke you on any joint Bad and Evils back bitch You might experience some shortness of breath As you sit with your lungs punctured Hear their motherfuckin tears come pourin If I tell you once more then you re done for You re going to have to learn How to fuckin hear from a ruptured eardrum Forrest am I clear You Gump you re as dumb as a stump To think wed come with a trunk shortage B b b b bass in your face bitch Chuck Norris nunchucks morph into guns swords This is what blood sport is The goriest glorious notorious bigamous shogun warriors God damn the Slaughter boy general Once I slaughter it you couldn t un slaughter it Once I order a hit you couldn t un order it Hits an order this the consortium From the moment I go to bed til I wake up All day this is all I can think about baby So I go straight at opponents heads with this anger Always cause this is all I can think about baby If I don t got no more drama bitch I m a fish outta water bottle After all these guys I slaughter Applause is gettin louder how the fuck did this happen I never rapped for bitches hows it that my audience now is broader Devil without a cause rebel without a pause I am a kaze without the kami You wouldn t be a G if you cost me a thousand dollars Infrared in my pencil lead But always keep an extra one stocked though In the back pocket and both of em locked And theyre loaded like cocked twin Glocks that I m holdin You better pause when you see these two dots on your colon Fuckin punks you wait just got to rockin and rollin Cause Elvis ain t left the buildin yet I m still a villain You feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec With the weapon of intellect Hannibal Lecter with the black belt In kung fu protect your neck and Respect the gun rule Read in the Art of War book by Sun Tzu You realize if you defy you probably wont be around here long Rapunzel Look bitch I got the bands in my pocket And the drum roll poppin thats That s overkill I keep the kill under me I keep the chill one degree I hit you with a hook that ll make you see threes You realize as soon as you beat me that you didn t Yeah there s still one of me now me slap you That s a recap view that s normal embarrassing And you slap me that s knee slap humor that s hardly hilarious So we scrap over you lyin like a feline cub in a forest Cherishing a kill from a dominant male And I m born with Malaria Form of Lou Gehrigs To torture and terrify corporate America Poor little Erica In the morning the sheriffs and Law Enforcement Will find one fourth of her buried Under a barrier of the kitchen floor With the stairs in an outdoor wooded area From the moment I go to bed til I wake up All day this is all I can think about baby So I go straight at opponents heads with this anger Always cause this is all I can think about baby Back then hoes didnt want him Now the black Benz all hittin corners My spectacular vernacular I spit like giving Ex Lax to Dracula Let me translate I m tryna find me a bitch And then I m sucking on her neck while she naked And then I m shitting on her And I m getting boners from what I m spitting Getting blown to smithereens in a Toyota Getting stoner Jonas Brothers Brothers songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flipping A time bomb with a nervous tick Another murder victim I flirted with them first And brrr stick em Id burn up if I try to step foot inside a Churchs Chicken chka Wanna chka make sure any who battle me crawl away Assault and battery holiday and just when you re thinking that ll be all I say I ll start automatically calling names and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy But I disappear as quick as Natalee Holloway It s my mentality all the way I m normally a suicide mission to try dissin But one thing I never minds getting called Elvis all the time In the articles that you write which is why I never reply cause he died shitting So a shitting Im spitting my infinite supply of written bonafide Kidding aside critics take my little white dick in your eyelid like to fuck it Switch subjects moving on to the next one its Ch Chucky Who wanna play with number one overall Kid Cudi A psycho buddy who might go nutty cause he don t like nobody His knifes so bloody cause he just sliced somebody Pull out the Schick Hydro and In light of what he just said this for those who even kinda want it Cause for this man I would take a lighter And light up all of my Lighter money You can call it pyro money Hi Rihanna I mean wait Hi Tianna wait Hi Tatiana shit I gotta problem I don t like its called fuck a model itis Who pussy the tightest That s amazing sit your ass down I don t like the pussy too tight Get the fuck outta here and have some babies Vocabulary still ill the still will It s all yellow with the black stripe Kill Bill I m so far ahead of the skills here Getting ready for my past life I m the real deal Like Holyfield think you irreplaceable Bite it Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill and Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal you know the deal I m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel Of how I m how I m cold still like an old closed snowmobile And no feeling but so jovial But don t be one of those who mistake me for a joke Im so for real It s what I told the phony emcee before I broke his will Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul Told him when I snap like a photo He ll get exposed like a roll of film Now here he goes again oh I m so trill I mma get the hoes again Like Buffalo Bills bitch you didn t put lotion in The bucket fuck it beat the poor little old widow With throw pillows soap brillos finished my goat milk then Smoke billows I lit up ah fuck it Embed

Right for Me Lyrics I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals glue sniffin pools of vomit at Bonnaroo But I dont know if Im in Tennessee Chicago or Houston In the corner tryin to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I wont even swallow solid food Alcoholic too plus Im on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off Im on mushrooms so fuck all of you Roses are violet mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion its all an illusion Its probably the shrooms Im on Cause I think I started hallucinating cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Futures new shit And all I could do was follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so Im not as deluded Cause all this delusion got me seein shit Excusez moi but that hoochie that passed You see her ass Wouldnt make her my main squeeze Butt juicier ass it belongs in a juicer Its mouth waterin too So I walked over to her like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards Ill introduce ya Oh Im a misogynist too but Im not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin off on the youth uh Chronic abuser and I dont mean a user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka a shotgun a Ruger a Glock and a nuke And a Rottweiler too and Im not in the mood so When I say Im bringing the TEC out Im not coming to repair your fuckin electronic computers God Im gonna puke Im so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah Im tore up demolished Im fuckin stoned like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes That were placed next to Veronicas boobs And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for him Right for me change me Rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me Don t laugh please listen to me Thought I d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps relapsing under that Well thats a bunch of crap In the clutch Im the Captain Crunch of rap And Im sick of acting humble thats enough of that Fuck that shit cut the sack Like its a natural reaction Thats why Im actually trapped in this shoving match Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passion and hungers back What a fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track Its like verbal acrobatics but in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin crashed my hovercraft After I strapped a duffel bag to my back And stuffed a massive punchin bag in it And an elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back recovered back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick lunge on back Latch on a NASA shuttle flap fuckin snap the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed utter my last rebuttal And just as Im to come crashin I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat Rub my magic mushroom tat For luck then splat get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gasp lungs collapsed And thats more likely than finding someone thats Right for me change me Rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me Don t laugh please listen to me Couple of shots of J ger Public intoxication dis fuckin combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin Youre top ten aint cha Stop it you fuckers are talkin crazy And stop interrupting youre not even up in that conversation Whether youre punchin a clock or famous Underground pop or nameless Whatever your job is I give a fuck whats your occupation Youre thinkin just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan If you dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles bacon A fuckin McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it Flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said fuck it and lost my patience They all woke up from sedation Aint none of you Dr Dre so then what is it got you thinkin You can fuck with this operation Still running hip hop amazin Im still pluggin along No need for an assumption heres confirmation Im up for the long duration Im just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though Ill probably be jumpin across the stage Til Im fuckin Madonnas age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like Im plugged up with constipation That day will come Before I finally stumble upon some lady that s Right for me change me Rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me Don t laugh please listen to me Embed

How Come Lyrics So I changed huh You got a phone Pick it up call me How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you We were so young so full of life and vibrance Side by side wherever you was riding I went So close almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit When Ronnie died you was right by my side With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it You even had the same type of childhood I did Sometimes I just wanna know why is it That you succame to yours and mine I survived it You ran the streets I nine to fived it We grew up grew apart as time went by us Then I blew up to both yours and mines surprises Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it Much as your pride tries to hide it Youre cold your touch is just like ice And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I dont like it How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse On my own album with a deal but shit got worse Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first Fore I let him disrespect me or check me over some worrisome Bitch that I wasnt with I woulda hit it and quit But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit I told you dont get involved with her You would smoke in the car with her Coming out of the bar with her stumbling half drunk Like yall was husband and wife or something But me catching her fuckin other niggas Mustve hurt your pride or something Cause you woof off at the mouth to people Like you want it with me When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced You acting like I aint your mans and lying like she cant be loose But I am really your friend Im just trying to tell you the truth Dont hate the game or the player the one thats changing is you How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block And homies in the hood only see me on the tube So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude Fools I used to rap with all expect magic Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown Shady made it so my babies aint starving at home See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end I peep the hatreds in your eyes and the Satan in your lies Aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise How come when you talk its with bitter and spite And how come it was my fault for what you did with your life And every time I go to hear you and play you look away We barely embrace you cant even look me in my face How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you Embed
G O A T Lyrics And I m willing to borrow your grass But I specialize in eating MCs In the immortal words of LL Cool J As he would say Im a G O A T And for those of yall who dont know what a G O A T is It means the Greatest Of All Time And I consider myself one of those So thank you very much here it goes This is the part I was worried about Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes And Im in some dusty garage Inhalin them carbon monoxide fumes And everyones tellin me what I should do And how I should come out and what to rap about And I know that I got a lot up In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out And Im not sure how this is gonna come off Theyre probably gonna think that Im comin off as cocky Like I just started givin a fuck what you really think about me See the thing about me Is you dont really know a thing about me Everyones makin a stink about me Like theres some kind of an aura of that of the king around me Surround me with nothin but gangsters Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals And I feel like Im more comfortable around them Than I do my own motherfuckin neighbors But see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave But why does it seem like Im not even put up in the same category as other MCs So when Weezy says that hes better than Jay Z Please be that just subliminally Means he thinks Jiggas the best And that hes the only one up in that league see And its easy just to consider me One of the greatest white rappers there is Knowin goddamn well that Im one of the best motherfuckin rappers who ever lived period Im a G O A T and I dont mean to gloat But I know what I know and I know what you think And these magazinesll never put it in ink Because how would it look if they considered me as a G O A T And for those of yall who dont know what a G O A T is It means the Greatest Of All Time And I consider myself one of those So thank you very much here it goes Maybe they figure that Im on my way out the game So they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem or a new Shady If they think its gonna happen man I thought I was crazy Or maybe I could be takin it wrong And theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way See you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin up Paul Walls white Cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight And Bubba Sparxxx he just wont write Because hes so caught up in that snow white That Timbaland cant even get him in the studio Hes so gone off that coke right And its so sad cause hes dope right Americas next great white hope right So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass White Rapper Show right And which Im still havin mixed feelings about They said itd be real Im just spillin it out Theres somethin about a white boy talkin black And runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit Isnt it ironic that the best rappers white And the best golfers black And Im the one whos gotta catch all the flack off of that But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until Mile had came out But I had already hit middle America Parents had all got to likin me now When suddenly I wasnt such a bad guy All of the hatred for me mustve died Thought I committed career suicide So I had to turn back into the bad guy So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy And Angelina Jolie is just another ho And Brad is a sucka because once I fuck her She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby You know what I say No You better save some of them kids from Madonna She needs all the publicity she can get You wanted Shady well you got it man I aint apologizin for shit Im a G O A T and I dont mean to gloat But I know what I know and I know what you think And these magazinesll never put it in ink Because how would it look If they considered me as a G O A T And for those of yall who dont know what a G O A T is It means the Greatest Of All Time And I consider myself one of those So thank you very much here it goes Man Im takin my ball and goin home Man shit is too easy Nobody even wants to pass me the ball Cause Im a G O A T So dont worry Im out the motherfuckin game And yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best But yall know that Im a G O A T And like I said Im one of the motherfuckin best Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch But before I go Id like to say fuck you very much To everybody who wasnt there from the start And thank you very much to everybody who was And yall aint gotta say it just think it Cause I know that you know that I know That you know that I know that Im a G O A T Im out yall its been real peace Embed
COFFIN Lyrics We fought until the sun rose And I still aint been to bed And while you got your eyes closed The devil wakes up in my head He told me that you hate me and you blame me And you said that you wish that you were dead So I write a little note out Suicidal love roulette You make me wanna jump off the roof Cause I love you to death just like a fool Id rather a coffin handmade for two Cause I love you to death just like a fool Just like a fool Just like a fool I walk up to the edge yeah And say a prayer before I let go Ill probably see you through the window While Im falling past the fifth floor Then you get there just in time to save me and apologize And maybe we can go back to bed But you run past me instead And hit the ground before I can I had to watch ya jump from the roof Boy I love you to death just like a fool Well need a coffin handmade for two Cause I love you to death just like a fool Just like a fool uh Maybe Buddhas got it right We reincarnate every time And Ill find you in another life Maybe Buddhas got it right We reincarnate every time And Ill find you in another life I dont really wanna fight I just wanna spend the night But I dont wanna spend the night Actin out Love the Way You Lie But the shit just went awry Hit me in the eye bit me in the thigh then begin to cry Im at the end of my wits lets end this ma Then begin again tomorrow Fresh start let you spoil me Pledge your loyalty treat me like a king Just to fuck me over royally Boy are we water mixed with oil See another shouting match bout to have it out But no matter how mad I get Im so mad about you Forgot what I was even mad about I know weve had our challenges still I keep trying to salvage it you Wanna sabotage it Im down to the hill But you think Im fucking around on you chill It never changes I doubt if it will Cheat on me then say How does it feel I feel like blowing my fucking head off After I write you out of my will Bitch how could you Almost had a child wit you Woulda settled down wit you Now Ill put you in the ground and bury myself wit you I dont get you its as if youre drowning I stick my hand out but you fool me Youre just trying to pull me down wit you Thought it was you my world revolve around I should aim a revolver round at you proof guess Im making my way to the roof Youre a traitor I say that were through You hop in the elevator then you Say the coffin they better make it for two Cause if you jump Im jumpin with you And neither one of us have nothing to lose but each other Were just a couple of fools You make me wanna jump off the roof Cause I love you to death just like a fool Well need a coffin handmade for two Cause I love you to death just like a fool You make me wanna jump off the roof Cause I love you to death just like a fool Well need a coffin handmade for two Cause I love you to death just like a fool Just like a fool Just like a fool Embed

things You mustve had yourself a bag of shrooms I make a call make em fake a fall My clique is too sick say goodbye In the streets where the stakes is high like Ruths Chris Im from the city of true shit Where the mayor went to jail For bein a player right after Proof split Levels the head of competitors Royce that Im drinkin everyday til Hex Murda get his regular voice back Ras I got ya look scared at ya blast from ya From a block away ask Tricky Im that niggie Im more hooder than black Dickies I rap like committin suicide in the booth takin the track with me Patr ns in my chromosomes In

Quitter Lyrics Yo I dedicate this to you To all my fans keeping yall in health Lets tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself Cause its cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and Which I create cause thats my mission So listen close to what we say Because this type of fag claims to never be gay I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you I upset you cause I get respect I bet you Im even liked better by your niece and nephew And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood No respect in the hood fled to his neck of the woods Got in touch with his roots found the redneck in his blood And said Heck country western rap records are good So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes He cant rap or sing but he wants to do both Puts an album out and rules for part of the year Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere Its the start of an era rock raps harder this year No ones tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair Sittin on stage strummin acoustic guitar in your ear So you start to get scared sit back and spark an idea Figure you can diss me to jump start your career I punch you in your fucking chest til your heart kicks in gear And fuck your underground buddies nameless crew Like Imma say they names so they can be famous too You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along And the days of House of Pain are gone And if you talk about my little girl in a song again Imma kill you Imma kill you You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along And the days of House of Pain are gone And if you talk about my little girl in a song again Imma kill you I swear to God Imma kill you Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke To the rap you wrote your fuckin answer backs a joke And Imma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you Like I aint notice you Bitch I had a show to do Like Im supposed to be star struck come over to you You better shut your fuckin mouth while you O for two Back in Limp opened the show for you Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you Took

Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker But never last and Everlast is a Quitter and you bitter cause I came along And the days of House of Pain are gone And if you talk about my little girl in a

Foolish Pride Lyrics Yo man yo Marsh man Yo youve been kickin all this shit about yourself What of the homies man Oh you want one about the posse Alright Ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride Oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say You got foolish pride like you got tooth decay But tooth decay is another problem So lets take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it Now when I talk about foolish pride I mean blacks and whites taking different sides When blacks and whites take different sides Unity never happens and we will subside We will subside and hatred will release And everything will just crush that peace But when we crush that peace you see we start hatin each other But remember you are my brother and you are my sister Just like Im a mister I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her I kissed her I placed it on her cheek And she didnt come back til next week Now it was next week and she was back again Wanting to kiss a white kid So she was my girlfriend we started going out But thats okay because we were black and white Blacks and whites sometimes mix But black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks So Ima say like this Dont date a black girl take it as a diss If you want but if you dont Ima tell you like this I surely wont Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money And that shit aint funny So Ima say Look honey Why do you do this You know you step up to me like you a Brutus Then you try to grab my spinach Because its green and thats cash So get outta here cause I dont need your ass I said that before but thats okay because like I said youre a whore Black girls and white girls just dont mix Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks White girls are good I like white girls I like white girls all over the world White girls are fine and they blow my mind And thats why Im here now telling you this rhyme Cause black girls I really dont like We dont mix its like riding a bike When youre peddling hard uphill both ways You know its kinda hard and thats why I say to you Im giving you a little advice Dont date a black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice You wont ever do it again because theyll take your money And that aint funny So Ima say Look honey Ive already said that before But like I said again youre nothing but a big whore So when Mike catch on the bass line Thats okay cause we will not just waste time Ill get straight to the point black girls are bitches Thats why Ima tell you you better pull up your britches Cause all that cash is making your ass drag From the boyfriend you ganked and thats pretty bad I mean thats pretty sad when youre dating a black guy And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy Now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking But thats okay because you need a god damn spanking From me the funky M M Im busting rhymes and Im swallowing phlegm Im busting a freestyle just like this I say swallowing phlegm and Howard gets pissed But when Howard gets pissed thats okay Because he leaves and he doesnt show up for two more days So Ill just worry about that problem when I come to it Ill cross that bridge when I come to it Cause I forgot the chorus But thats okay cause yall saying Bust a rhyme for us So Ima bust another rhyme about this black girl She turned out to be a fuckin wack girl A wack girl because black girls aint funny All they want is your goddamn money They take you for everything youve got And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand So Ima kick it to you just like this How does the chorus go I forgot But thats okay cause Ima tell you in stride Ima say Ole foolish pride Ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride Oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride Oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride Oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh Date a white girl cause they got the raw hide Embed

Lose Yourself Lyrics Yo if you could just for one minute Or one split second in time forget everything Everything that bothers you All your problems everything and follow me If I was froze inside of a moment If I could capture time inside a capsule an hourglass full Of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it Then I can trap it so no more time elapses through it If raps could do it maybe I could tap into it Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks To transmit through em to make you put your ass into it And thats when you hit the roof because you cant sit through it Your passions too much for you to not be dancin to it And as you do it your movements become fast and fluent Youre mashin to it moshin til youre black and bluish Youre actin foolish this music it has influenced You to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion true its Chaotic but its got your body movin as a unit Unitin together tonight so make it last and you better just Lose yourself in this music this moment We own it we wont never let it go You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait There is no time to sit there and procrastinate Lose yourself in this music this moment We own it we wont never let it go You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait There is no time to sit there and procrastinate You better As we descend together we begin to move as one In perfect unison just like the moon and sun Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum Rhythmically in sync if youll excuse the pun But if you could lose it once I mean if you could let shit go Relax take a breath and just let it exit slow To rest your soul you could leave the rest to me If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy To make em feel the feelin that Im feelin right this minute Cause I feel like the night wont end until I get finished So close the shades makin sure no light gets in it The skys the limit tonight because the nights infinite A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like whats spinnin His life was spinnin the whole entire night just spinnin Like lifes beginning To come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it Lose yourself in this music this moment We own it we wont never let it go You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait There is no time to sit there and procrastinate Lose yourself in this music this moment We own it we wont never let it go You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait There is no time to sit there and procrastinate You better Embed

Never Enough Lyrics Theres not much you could do or say to phase me People think Im a little bit crazy I get it from all angles even occasionally Doc Dre zie Will have to step in every once in a while to save me To make me stop and think about it fore I just say things Sometimes I forget what other people just may think A lot of rappers probably wouldnt know how to take me If they heard some shit Id lay the tape fore they erased me I may be a little too fast paced and racy Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me Twenty times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem Like Im goin too fast cause my mind is racing And I could give a fuck what category you place me Long as when Im pushing up daisies And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats When I hit the heavenly gates Ill be cool beside Jay Z For every single die hard fan who embraced me Im thankful for the talent in which God gave me And Im thankful for the environment that he placed me Believe it or not I thank my mom for how she raised me In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me It only made me what I am today see Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me You aint gonna make or break me Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake G Youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me And when you face me with all the shit youve been saving To say to me you had all this time to think about it Now dont pussy out and try to about face me Cause Ive been patiently waiting for the day That we finally meet in the same place to see No matter how many battles I been in and won No matter how many magazines on my nuts No matter how many emcees I eat up Oh its never enough No matter how many battles I been in and won No matter how many magazines on my nuts No matter how many emcees I eat up Oh oh its never enough My flows untouchable now you gotta face it Uh oh it gets worse when I go back to the basics You gon say the wrong shit and get your whole face split The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it I spot my target blaze it direct hit Graze it your peace talk save it Your shit sounds dated youre overrated Im obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers If Im the best and the worst then Gods gift is a curse Soldier trained to destroy you payin attention boy I spit shit slick shit so quick you miss it To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic My music is a drug press play you aint gotta sniff it Shoot it or pop it roll it bag it or chop it Itll get you high over and over but you gotta cop it When its hot its hot your hatin is undeniable stop it No matter how many battles I been in and won No matter how many magazines on my nuts No matter how many emcees I eat up Oh its never enough No matter how many battles I been in and won No matter how many magazines on my nuts No matter how many emcees I eat up Oh oh its never enough Embed

If I Told You Lyrics Uh What if I told you that I was different What if I told you that somethings missin And what if I told you were not alike And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture What if I told you I feel divided Keep to myself and Im awfully quiet And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts Trapped in the dark and I tried to hide it No Im not a slave to no fuckin fairy tale I bet you think that you know me very well Make no mistake this is not a cry for help Cause I dont owe no one no explanation on how I feel But on the real what if I told you that I was brave I grew up different than I was raised But still what if I told you Im out of place Wait What if I told you that I was gay Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Yeah What if I told you Im not alright I mean I dont feel dead but Im not alive And what if I told you Im not like you And the shit Ive been goin through itll prolly make you cry And what if I told you Im not this And the person you think you know dont exist Look Im not who you know Im not who you wish Im not who you want me to be what you want from me isnt this I grew up in church where I couldnt be myself I felt like a prisoner couldnt leave my cell They told me God dont like ugly and this an ugly world And if I ever seen things different then I would burn in hell And on the real this is not new this is not a phase I grew up different than I was raised But still what if I told you Im out of place Wait What if I told you that I was gay Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh What if I told you Im homophobic And you have zero control over your impulses And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit Its something I cant sugarcoat its repulsive We were homies since children I thought it But thought I was buggin though Cause wed sit chill and just talk chicks Now how can we be friends still after all this Unless I can convince you to repent Ask God to forgive you for your sins And begin healin your conscience And rid you of this sick illness that causes it Part of me wishes youd kept this shit still in the closet Im white but Im gettin mixed feelings like Logic Yeah Im pissed off a little this is a choice We were supposed to be boys Youre actin like this aint optional What if I said you was weak Cause you dont got the strength to conquer some biological monster thats part of you Thats responsible for them homosexual thoughts If you dont want a lecture part Like a sofa section or long as you Make your decision and stand by it but I cant be beside it Cause for me thatd be next to impossible Or you learn to control your urges You say Its like pullin teeth and morals are oral surgeons But how would you even know anyways if youre a virgin Why cant you be a normal person What if I tried steerin you towards a girlfriend Wouldnt work would it You seem pretty surefooted Im sure good at judgin but I have no right I know goodbye seems cold right Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night And no I didnt know you would go right home and go take your own life I aint mean for that shit to happen I said I wont cry I let the best friend that Ive ever known die Alone was gonna tell you the next day Im so sorry Im fightin my own demons I wont lie They wont leave me alone eating at my soul this whole time Ive been tortured imprisoned in my own mind A born again Christian but Lord if youre listenin We might be headed for a collision Cause when I told my boy I couldnt support his decision I was tryna make it seem like a choice when it isnt Cant be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude What If I told you my wish never came true What if Im a hypocrite whos afraid to just face truth Wait What if I told you Im gay too Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh Duh nuh Embed

Eminem Sway In The Morning Freestyle Lyrics Lets take them back to the future Bars like Paul Rosenberg The small frozen turd Alright look I had class I just got expelled I excelled at nothing in school So if youre tryna test my patience it just failed But King Mathers I still get hailed So call me sire like I exhaled After I had a deep ass breath held I guess well thatll make my size double XL So kiss your highnesss hinded ass While Im trying to stretch its time to exercise Im flexing isometrics Twice the reps til I get extra sized And set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire Cause Im coming out guns blazing Like flaming pythons my suggestion is parental discretion Be advised due to this mental aggression We advise you to back up like Byron Leftwich Im infectious I rhyme like I got a sinus infection A virus Im congested and I just ingested Five Allegras but the side effects from these anti depressants theyre tryna mess with my mind Im a regular Hyde and Jekyll White with freckles but I silence hecklers You might wanna head for the fire exits Im coming through like a wrecking ball You would swear I think highly of Miley And I respect her the way I backhand her Excuse my French Montana but I am worried about nutting God damn it Im a sexist I drive a Lexus Textses out of her mind and Im in Texas With a chainsaw wait what did I forget this Time oh my machetes getting upset he said He was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed It was time hes restless He wants to make blood shed like a storage unit But before I do it let me think this through Cause if I behead this bitch then Id be headless Mic check one two I aint barely check the mic just yet And I just sweared like twice as many times In less than ninety seconds Than Andrew fucking Dice ever did in his fucking life But I guess Im expected to make these kinds of violent records Its why I keep rhyming reckless Fuck it I swear like a diamond necklace Since freestyling over phone tap my lines connected With rhymes that kept in touch with the fans thats why the more bars the better my reception And I give a fuck about sales and fuck pop I dont even like refreshments Cindy Crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw At the waffle house awful mouth But if you dont like what Im talking about then block me out Just then Foxy Brown walks up and knocks me down Kicks me and socks me ow Apparently still mad over what I said last year On that Vegas track I just look stupid and stand there And try to act like I cant hear What Sorry dear but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear Thats when my man Denaun Porter ran behind me to pantomime That if you wanna kick his ass stand in line Hands inside my pants as I fantasize taking advantage Of Brandy and Janet by grabbing my Spanish Fly Like a blind Hispanic guy with his zipper stuck Give a fuck its all part of my grand design To get Amanda Bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion Better watch your step you bout to cross an outlandish mine Im what you get if Aaron Hernandez rhymed So stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy I am with a branding iron Fuck talking clear so you all can hear Id

Goodbye Lyrics Oy yeah Beautiful I remember it like it just happened I couldve sworn it was a dream But in reality it hit me like a nightmare Or at least thats how it seemed I just got a grip on our relationship We was ironing things out started picking up steam And when we didnt need it is when it all got heated And we both said some things that we probably didnt mean Then God intervened guess more was at stake Thought we left nothing over he put more on the plate She came home from the doctor with news Ive been wanting Says family was incoming shes pregnant twins coming But thats gotta be a lie She sighed couldnt stop the tears coming from her eyes That birth control she on for them its suicide As long as its still inside two of them wouldnt survive Hard turn from memorable to cynical Picturing clothes for what wouldve been identical Similar outfits similar names My deceased kids ultrasound in a frame So Im deprived of my chance to be a better dad Staring at my twins that I never had I shed a tear looking up in the sky Even though yall just got here goodbye Goodbye goodbye so long farewell But its not the end of the chapter Goodbye goodbye so long farewell Ill see you again in the afterlife My biological sperm donor didnt wanna be a daddy So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us Turned on us out the clear blue His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview I still love him yo but I love his brother more My uncle showed me love no one could know Young and poor with a tougher road To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc would hold Us down help moms lift the motherload I got grown and I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man He provided that feeling told me to take my career into my own hands He was there when I had no fans My cellphone rings and after I answer A voice says Your uncles been diagnosed with cancer Worst news in my life Him and chemo going rounds with a disease and theyre both losing the fight Im rushing up to Cedars Sinai Praying for a miracle I dont wanna see my idol die Before he did the look in his eyes Said Even though you just got here goodbye Goodbye goodbye so long farewell But its not the end of the chapter Goodbye goodbye so long farewell Ill see you again in the afterlife Ill see you again in the afterlife Someday in heaven we will reunite The flesh disappears but the soul survives Till next time my friend farewell goodbye I walked in your daughters house knowing that you gone But still looking out the corner of my eye hoping youre on the couch That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up Ironic I was on tour with Tech N ne and Slaughterhouse D tried to talk to me Crystal rubbed my back as they was pouring out I caught the next thing soaring out Now Im in the air in the midwest somewhere They said turbulence was severe I dont know what they talking bout I aint feel a bump body numb mind drifting Im sniffling asthma acting up Im whistling Im wishing my mothers face looked so much different Im kissing my son my aunt pacing in the kitchen My vision blurry still I saw your face clear What a loss this time I did more than waste beer Michelles strong she held on we got all the way there Then we walked in she fell on the floor this aint fair You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that aint clear Hey granny I was fifth row at the Grammys An award they aint hand me but I sat behind Will And right in front of Wayne and got seen by the family I miss the early morning convos believe me Regis on the TV and the best baked ziti But you had an all white affair grandpas all fly Even though you been got there goodbye Goodbye goodbye so long farewell But its not the end of the chapter Goodbye goodbye so long farewell Ill see you again in the afterlife Embed
Boys Lyrics Ryans a homicidal misfit I write the solution of biophysics On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics This my admission to having violent psychotic wit Devour polish it politics By the way Im higher than the Eiffel Tower tip I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass Before I write your shit pause inhaling hella kush Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push Felons crooks going door to door Like we selling books Dolly Parton style melons mushed Now my bitch a dancer Im about as sick as cancer If you could swallow my style youd probably rip your pants up If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther They call me anchorman I hold down the ship Leave you niggas floating in water then go and drown a fish Fuck Im fucking heinous I make you fucking famous Them lead showers is coming fuck is you saying Fuck Its fucking raining shit Theres lightning bitch Its thundering cause Im cussing up a storm if you wondering shit Shit You couldnt muster up enough thought Just take a dump during a brain fart chump If you want urine in your face all you had to do was say That you wish you wouldve just stayed pissed off in the first place We came to monopolize the game Illuminati is here Yeah human oddities at odds with us your squads gotta be Cause we started out cold in a snowball we froze Soon as we rolled up on these hoes alls we know Is yall lowered the bar like limbo you know who you are So quit fucking the dog before we start calling you Bizarre Shit screw the pooch yall done raped a pitbull Fell in love with the Shih Tzu this missiles directed directly at you And this for these hoes who dont know me from a can of paint You must be huffing fuck a ball sack If the taints cant take you on a date you mistake me for a gentleman You and late man and Will I aint Im the bad guy Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pees gets a black eye Must be outta your mind You think you fucking with us Suck on these nuts bitch hang it up This game is over Puffin loosies watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey Crazy how the fuck could you son me Im Shady Will there ever come a day when they could slay me I dont know fifth month black and yellow insect maybe Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me Everything you kick weak your spit kung fugazi All my homeboys Boys Nickel I just picked up a Phantom look how it rolls Royce Even if I wanted to quit I aint got no choice Verses keep coming I should invoice my own voice You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist Hoes be like diamonds in your chain man so moiss Bang bang bang bang House Gang chainsaw Here to kill you pussies dont ask what we came for I write until my right arm veins sore Forearm feel like Thors arm in a gang war You hear that Yaowa you know who finna fall out Definitively finish you my fist take out that eyeball Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night Coming up never saw light but never lost sight Jets and movers cesspoolers meth abusers You step to us TECs Rugers to respect the shooters My men think in sync roll with the best crew Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger Welcome to neighborhood big in the jects G Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck So Im well prepped if you just want war There will be blood everywhere you be laying on the Louboutin floor Its raw you keeping acting like you dont know Mouse nigga And you going to need the best doctors House nigga Guard your jewels and avoid large tools Cause after I spill you at the light you be in a car pool Keep your distance from idiots cause the truth told They food for thoughts rotten they gems are fools gold Need results from my actions mistakes Ill exonerate Im Martin King staring at a picture of Obamas face Talking funds niggas aint never seen stock I dont need the key to the game I pick a mean lock Must be outta your mind You think you fucking with us Suck on these nuts bitch hang it up This game is over Take off you invited inside of the mind of A psychotic rhymer Im kind of a Im grinding up rappers Im lining up jackers Im climbing up ladders I buy enough clappers to retire you factors fire at drama You liars and actors Im the genuine article But read me wrong get my gun and split you to particles Tell me when and Im there Not only heir to the throne but my chair is suspended in air Stay fly like unlimited fare You got us pegged wrong my circle dont fit in with squares I smell shit and piss know where its coming from You stepped on number two just to be number one Now Imma step on you bring it to your yard Bogart for arts we go hard You frauds just blow hard like broads I coast guard the West Im Mozart I compose dark shit with no heart I got Jim Beam in the liver getting head like clean clippers With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper When I throw up s like I drink liquor You think you seen sick Well bitch you aint seen sicker Than a cracker thatll hop around in a hospital gown Popping the trunk my pump will stay cocking the rounds I shit logs and I piss river brown Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile And thats as close as I get to a pyramid Shit they think Im Illuminati so fucking ignorant Sick with a grin here with this pen so innocent But when you win they say you a sin but in the end They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing Skinny ass pants sagging its only yourself you playing Call me a clown but you love what the clowns sanging Im a freak shows at the county carnival then you paying Bitch Im on a trapeze with no legs in the dark Yelling Go Shady driving slower than an old lady In an old no piece if you pay me Give me peace sign on my grill no Mercedes Im getting paid for these shows that I throw lately Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies They call me crazy cause I made it Bitch you crazy cause you quit look at my clique lately You aint fucking with Budden you aint got no choice with Royce You dont want to see the Crooked I well listen to Ortiz voice That dirt road hit the Mile the point oh boys And if Marshall want me to clap then homie I deploy game over Yo I dont think they heard you tell em again Game over Embed

Heartbreak Lyrics You used to be so cool what the fuck happened to you Look at what all this rapping and money stacking will do I couldve been stuck out in Bama had I not flew the coop And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa aint got no loot Uh money aint the issue you said thats funny now Cause moneys all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth Here take grand and buy yourself a lawyer Shit heres a whip so my kids aint gotta walk to the store for ya fuck Momma told me I should keep it real My record aint selling momma Im trying hard enough to keep a deal Meanwhile Im throwing paper down into an empty pit I got a business Im trying to run man fuck this bitch I shouldve seen it coming she never pulled her weight Im carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate You gassed em Yelawolf you better pump your fucking brakes asshole You got the nerve to Wanna talk about heartbreak oh oh Baby Ive been around you know Ive been around And I cant pretend to love you right now So you can go cry your heart out until you drown Hope you can swim it out cause I cant be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down You got some nerve to be mad at me for fuck anything What have I done besides give you what I could not afford The kids are happy cause they really dont know anything If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford The vacation they could be taking when daddys on tour Wait you are on vacation thats what this shit is for I get it Im like the fountain of youth Youre in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier true This song aint no diss its a living proof Skit of skin and tooth the witch in you bit left me with cracked roofs I aint done bitch put this shit in loop Heres a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do ooh You wanna walk around like its all good Cause Im the golden ticket to get out of the hood You better hope somebody cares more than I do Cause my will dont include you Wanna talk about heartbreak oh oh Baby Ive been around you know Ive been around And I cant pretend to love you right now So you can go cry your heart out until you drown Hope you can swim it out cause I cant be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down There aint no fucking way Imma let you take this hard earned money bitch And I cant pretend to love you right now So you can go cry your heart out until you drown Hope you can swim it out cause I cant be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down Hold up wait a minute let me drop this shit up in it Therell always be a special place For you in my bank account You fucking bitch Wanna talk about heartbreak oh oh Baby Ive been around you know Ive been around And I cant pretend to love you right now So you can go cry your heart out until you drown Hope you can swim it out cause I cant be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down There aint no fucking way Imma let you take this hard earned money bitch And I cant pretend to love you right now So you can go cry your heart out until you drown Hope you can swim it out cause I cant be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down Embed

Revelation Lyrics I dont wanna go to school I dont need no education I dont wanna be like you I dont wanna save the nation I just wanna live my life every day a celebration One day Ima leave this world Im waiting for the revelation I wanna kill myself Im still debating In front of a Baptist church masturbating praying to Satan Think Im crazy cause I smoke crack Live on B with the mac in a two family flat Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom My moms on her period my dads in my room I got ten rocks and I need to get out I sold them in five minutes at my own damn house My poor grandmother God bless her soul The bitch got AIDS she just waiting to die of a cold Theres three things that keep me from being a Nazi Im black a fag and my dads Liberace No matter how bad the beating I went to school cheating My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting Skipping school I had to have nuts just to do it Got bored and became truant When I had the gall to go I just couldnt do it I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel Getting threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel Like me outcast last to class First to leave when the teacher called on me Best believe I had something up my sleeve Ive been praised and labeled as crazed My mother was unable to raise me full of crazy rage An angry teenager nothing can change me back Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac I was boosting so influenced by music I used it As an excuse to do shit ooh I was stupid No one can tell me nothing hip hop overwhelmed me To the point where it had me in a whole nother realm It was like isolating myself was healthy It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy Compelled me to excel when school had failed me Expelled me and when the principal would tell me I was nothing and I wouldnt amount to shit I made my first million and counted it Now look at a fucking drop out that quit Stupid as shit rich as fuck and proud of it Thats why I dont wanna go to school I dont need no education I dont wanna be like you I dont wanna save the nation I just wanna live my life everyday a celebration One day Ima leave this world Im waiting for the revelation I was raised with a rifle and mask Steadily beating my psychiatrists ass just for asking about my past I was never on that punk shit fucking around Can get your beloved abducted smothered in blood quick You couldnt pay Swift to give a fuck Was crazy like my father it mustve been poison in that niggas nut Far as probation fuck peeing in cups I violate at any time let them see the blunt I grew up steadily masturbating inside of cells Young as hell having conversations with myself You could tell I wasnt lenient a disobedient Lynched and slapped teachers bitch Im not reading it You dont know what dogs go through a little nigga Sipping liquor with my old dude what the fuck you gon do Im quick to curse you I told my mother that Ima hurt you If you ever again mention that curfew Look my family ignores me and I dont like that They dont even listen when I tell them Ill be right back This nice beautiful house ma it dont mean shit Cause you know daddys a drunk and he dont clean shit And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man I couldnt stand up to him I just ducked and ran Im sick of this I wish on Christmas That I can get a loaded four fifth and put a fucking end to this I got no friends and I cant get a bitch Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips Nothing to smile about Im about to lose my mind Got me an automatic now Im wilding out When schools over pu pil are people to shoot through Kids going cuckoo with a two two Since my friend is this new dude in this high school Losing his noodle learn that people dont like you The football jocks is spitting on him Popular kids in school is now picking on him Burn out youngster niggas now hitting on him And his teacher in his english class keep flipping on him And now hes grounded with no allowances For drinking forty ounces cause he was caught by his counselors And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach Already got expelled for wearing a trench coat All I ever seen is Told me to keep silent stop battin my eyelids Its apparent that my parents werent parents at all Thats why I blow out my brains and slaughter you all I dont wanna go to school I dont need no education I dont wanna be like you I dont wanna save the nation I just wanna live my life everyday a celebration One day Ima leave this world Im waiting for the revelation If you dont eat your meat how can you have any pudding How can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat If you dont eat your meat you cant have any pudding You cant have any pudding if you dont eat your meat Embed

One Day at a Time Lyrics Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning Mind full of demons I dont wanna hear em anymore Got me heartbroken fine so many babies screamin Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human bein So they start smokin weed well never get our day Until we learn to pray keep our families in shape Cause they all broken why do ghetto birds die Before we learn to fly Somebody elses child Caught in gun smoke and we can all make a change So Im told but I havent seen the change unfold Ill keep hoping please if you prefer to breathe Communities in need of people that will lead Keep your eyes open I can only say Ill try Until the day I die I promise to be wise With my heart open greed brings only misery A way to tragedy so I stay sucker free Only a few chosen rise my ghetto queens rise Dont be afraid to try too many of us die For the door to open wide my brothers speak wise Stay focused on the prize though everybody dies We can only learn to take our anger and our hate Control our mental states settle down and set it straight Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes Before we said it regret it later and let it escalate Cause by then its just too late theres so much we can take And theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate To the point that he just breaks snaps and its all it takes You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes But we aint its grain to go against With every artist comes the image he portrays And the picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this angst Never once did you hear me say Im a gangster And I aint hear no complaints But I know that I will always continue to grow As long as I lead and never follow in no one elses shadow There will never be another me and that I can guarantee Thats why the fuck I remain sucker free To this day the game will never be the same No matter how much fame and success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do there will never be another you You can search but youll never find You can try to rewind time but in your hearts and your minds We will never die we are forever alive And we continue growin one day at a time Dont get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype Rappers are regular people minus money and lights Searchin for fortune and fame and superstardom All the jewelry all the cars whose crews the hardest Theres not a hip hop police the villains is watchin And the kids think beef is they only option Outlawz born filthy guilty as charged My memories of Kadaf while Makaveli lives on You think the industry is fun aint no pity with guns And when your money is up thats when your enemies come So if he died and came back would he try to save rap We needin a change the drama remains the same I spend my whole life fightin myself That I cant win so Im invitin some help And every now and then I take rights from the left Im still just like a kid lookin for stripes on my belt Yeah and that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope God take a like to myself No matter how much I try to stay alive Ima die a man still standin and in love with my pride Heard frivolous beats we past that Im tryin to keep some income coming in And collect on my ASCAP The rappers in the game aint changed And I finally realize that were not in the same game The hatin will never end so I guess Ill deal with it Them s will pop killas yes Im still with it The streets is military you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin One way at a time keep the faith in your mind And we continue growin one day at a time damn Embed

watch my seed grow up Fuck that This the fuckin thanks I get For tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down Cause you seein more support than Im seein my child Its like every day I wake up another drama Its a wonder Im alive survivin this karma If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her Without these cameras in our faces like animals For your Channel Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts And what we do in private since they wont let us put up a fence And you wonder why I carry every gun under the Sun Whether its unloaded full or an unregistered one No bullets Youre so full of shit This clip is so full itll spit if I dont pull it And dont give me no bullshit Im not in the mood I just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit Dont tell me bout the show business shit I know what this is Bitch Cause you dont know me I dont know you So dont approach me I wont approach you And dont insult me I wont insult you Cause you dont know what I will or I wont do Cause you dont know me and I dont know you So dont approach me I wont approach you And dont insult me I wont insult you Cause you dont know what I will or I wont do This aint business this is personal bitch You dont know Xzibit from shit new school class dismissed I had a very fucked up day Im needin this fifth Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the fifth Yo Em its time to get serious with it Time for everybody to feel it similar to the egg in the skillet This is your brain on drugs Xzibit rain on thugs Aint no neighborhood thats big enough to bang on us Aint no love lost my niggas relax yourself Im about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth To my niggas who never seen it I mean it when I holla At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel Changin your channel you played like a fuckin piano Ridin slow through Cali like Im ridin a camel Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels I feel like Tony Soprano who do I trust now Just hit me on my tele nigga soon as I touch down Spit lines to split spines just to get mine Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine Sniff lines of coke thats the only shit that make you dope Bitch ass nigga thats droppin the soap Get choked out and beat put your head in a vise grip And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself a front door with locks And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox And every time somebody makes a threat run and tell cops Fuck that I protect myself with these shots And one in the chamber gun in the waist And one in the ankle waitin for someone to come to my place Tryna walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face And its a disgrace Hailie cant play with her toys In the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn Screamin some shit leanin out your windows beepin and shit Or pullin up in my drive like I wont leap in your whip And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live So my address ends up on the Internet again So then I do an interview with Spin tellin them That if someone comes to my crib Ima shove a gun in their ribs And reporters blow it out of proportion Oh now hes pullin guns on his fans just for tryna stand on his porch And Im the bad guy cause I dont answer my door like Hey Hi You guys wants some autographs Okay form a straight line Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle And climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you Its not that I dont like you Its just that when Im not behind the mic Im a person whos just like you Embed

Demon Inside Lyrics Im possessed by evil demons that torture me while Im sleeping I keep dreaming of death and Im hearing people screaming The devils spirits trapped inside me and I want it out Im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house With both of my wrists slit Im lifted up in the air And suspended in animation like someones holding me there I feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes Tripping over ODd bodies of dead lushes Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes Doors open and close by themselves Books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adams apple Two cups of holy water and Im looking at em half full But as soon as I go to touch em they turn into red rum It got silent then all these voices said Come follow me into the gates of Hell I heard em yell Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother Covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess And told me thats just for starters Satanll be in to see me later To see if Im interested in being partners Embed

The Apple Lyrics Im a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history You will see that I am not the only one whos off his rocker there were many before me I was always labeled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed Id grow to be But if you take a look at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree Haha Haha haha haha Alright look Ima tell you the story from my side Maybe youll understand check it out You done witnessed unexplainable shit Too insane to explain people run from what they just dont get Maybe Shady should have just hit em with a little bit Did I spit too soon Should I have spoon fed em it But I was just so eager to prove I was even worth bein in the same league or the room Of the people of whom I was in Every now and then I look up like I was seekin approval Was it because of the pigment of my skin Or was it a figment of my imagination Maybe it bothered me more than it did them Maybe it wasnt a big deal back then But to me it was see what it was Was I had developed a complex from being judged Proof spit his verse now Im next lets see who balks Im in the booth starin back to see whose mugs I get a reaction from usually the first thumb Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals It was real we just wanted tickets for that meal Sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree I said sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg Cause she said that I had a baby sister Who fell out of the window I was too young to remember Kansas City projects I was like five six And how come I remember Malcolm Isaac and Boogy If it was the projects in Missouri Cause those were my best friends until Isaac Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back And ended up gettin jumped and cut in the gut With a switch and seventy some stitches Which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture Of a fictitious little sister who never existed And this is why a part of my lifes so twisted But I can never be as sick as that bitch is And by the way that pictures one of my relatives Sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree I said sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain To see why everything I say is so insane Whats different about my brain That separates me from other players in this game On the surface it may seem like a scheme Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy But thats the last thing I need Is for people to walk around feelin sorry for me And I am not a G never claimed to be I gave my vest to Ca his lets hope he dont need it more than me But well see cause we aint lookin for beef But if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek Come on Sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree I said sometimes I feel like its just me Sometimes I feel like Im goin crazy But take a look at my family Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree Yeah and Im the crazy one right Whatever then let me be the crazy one Balalalalalalalalalala Cuckoo cuckoo tweet Embed

I Remember Lyrics Your mother you fuckin faggot Ayo this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody Rest in peace we aint forget about you you fuckin homo we still remember There once was a man who liked to jump around But he got too old to jump up and down So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow Left his boys in the House of Pain It was the wisest decision he ever made But the dumbest thing he could ever do Was try to buck a on those that act shady Tell me now what you gonna do Cause I remember all those years how it was when you were here I remember how it was how it was when you were young Yesterday was so long ago Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Dont nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more I remember back when you had the Knack And I remember when you had your first heart attack I was right there laughin when I heard the news I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you Maybe Ice Ts right you are a bitch You come around when youre broke and you leave when youre rich But the dumbest thing you could ever do Was try to buck a on those that act shady Tell me now what you gonna do Cause I remember all those years how it was when you were here I remember how it was how it was when you were young Yesterday was so long ago Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Dont nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more Remember back in like right before Ms Everlast was Whitey Ford Before his heart attack had him on life support When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame And they became destined to never jump around again Or even further back when I first had heard The Knack And you were down with Syndicate I went to get your shit man I was into it But then you went and took your style and switched the shit Now you sound ridiculous you dickless piece of shit How could you diss me bitch I liked you thought you was alright for a white dude Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you Started rhymin then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nothin Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin Im sorry man I wasnt tryin to steal your light or nothin But youre a homosexual white rappin Irish Man I wish I was Irish I could be a Muslim too Then Id be confused as you and I wouldnt know what to do Whats up with you I never fucked with you why would you fuck with me Knowin I could rap circles around you what are you as nuts as me Plus I can sing better than you and I dont fuckin sing And probably play guitar better and I aint never touched a string But I aint mad at you Id hate me too if I was you Im what you used to be shit you was me in So everytime I write a lyric Imma think of you And maybe that will help me know what its like to sing the blues Cause I remember all those years how it was when you were here I remember how it was how it was when you were young Yesterday was so long ago Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Dont nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more You fuckin punk pussy you fuckin faggot sissy fuck And by the way a s a fuckin sissy gun If youre gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun you little bitch Next time say my fuckin name in a song dont be subliminal about it You wanna fuckin diss me diss me you fuckin faggot You fuckin punk pussy you fuckin little bitch fuckin cunt Embed

Ricky Ticky Toc Lyrics Once you call my name out things will never be the same They shouldve never let us get our foot in this game Ever since I was introduced to rap music I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice I could lose it At any moment those who know me know it So they probably told to go with the flow just so that I dont explode and have another episode Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did Im waiting for that next beef Im cocked locked and loaded Im ready to go so bad Im going bananas my dicks so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with Oh shit I mean when she was still bloated Before they cut her stomach open and lypod it Anybody I throw flames at gets a name Its a game cause they know that they dont spit the same Its a shame what people do for minutes of fame Every day its the same thing people in this game Try to buddy buddy us Just to get close enough to study us everybody just wants To have something to do with that They all trying to get that stamp they after that Shady Aftermath money Its like a monopoly They probably just now finally understand How to Rob fully Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me And Dre its like we hit the fucking lottery And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers When we rhyme with each other in time we discovered That we had more in common than we thought with each other Both robbed of our mothers our fathers aint want us What was wrong with us was it our fault Cause we started thinking God doesnt love us Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time What a coincidence cause when got shot up in Jamaica Queens I still remember the call up at Chung King cause Big L had just got popped just a month before If lives hes getting dropped from Columbia Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh Operate thats when he popped up at number one And we aint never gonna stop if you wondering Even if Im under the gun You aint got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye Therell always be animosity between you and I But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit Im still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual Egos aside fore I bruise em all Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nikes Earthlings how do you like these You gotta love em look at the bottom of em theyre like cleats Stomping I been romping Since Tim Dog was hollering Fuck Compton I was whiling freestyling Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes I wasnt even raps Elvis yet that tells us that Any doubts in your head that seals the shit Ricky ticky toc ticky ticky toc Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc Diggy Diggy Doc And ya dont stop Embed

Good Die Young Lyrics Dawg I shouldnt have left They wouldnt have tried that shit if I was with you Maybe he wouldve picked another time or maybe chose another way Or maybe my prayers wouldve convinced him to choose another soul Shit its just me mom and Tony now Man you look so peaceful right now How can I argue with that They say that the good die young They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know that we gon have fun In this life cause you only get one When God call for me dont cry I just went home Im sure that everybody heard their momma say thered be days like this When you see one of your friends die in the midst In the struggle into the circumstances A risk that they take just to prove a point to a friend Even then accidents are prone to happen To any man or woman thats dumb enough to pretend And huh God will hold them accountable for sins That they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent But I guess thats the way things go I was blessed to see twenty four To wake up to that Hi My Name Is video Motivated me to write what I wrote And I knew my little brother sold dope And mom and daddy wanted to move our row I did it I still got a lot to prove and show I just wish we aint have to lose Bugz to the struggle Cause you know They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know

niggas dont party They pull a fo fo out snatch off yo Cartis Thats why I keep the pistol under the truck Im years old too old to be getting jumped And fuck rap I miss Karnail Pitts B U G Z tatted on my wrist Me and you in the Jeep listen to screamo beats Its a shame me and Fuzz dont even speak I got married my wife name is Dee Peace to and I miss you I think back on that tragic day my phone rung And Bizarres voice telling me Bugz was going home It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldnt breathe I didnt wanna accept it didnt wanna believe it I swear at his wake dawg I cried so hard Literally Denaun had to carry me to the car While I stand in this booth now its tearing me apart But I had to let it out cause it was tearing at my heart Cause he died over something so petty and so small A human life is so very precious I hope yall Understand how Im feeling cause I love you Bugz I wanna rhyme with you laugh with you hug you Bugz But I cant and you were so close to see your dreams A coward came along and took you away from the team So dont mistake this track as just another song This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one Cause you know They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know that we gon have fun In this life cause you only get one When God call for me dont cry I just went home They say its never too late to have an early childhood If I could turn back the hands of time God should Forgive what I did as a kid that run blocks Now my dreams is just screams cops and gunshots The fun stops when your homies up in the box My doody Bo bless his soul snuffed by the cops I used to question a lot if theres a God around me say something If you love us so much why aint you gave nothing When he took my homie Snook was only in eleventh grade Now I hope to see his face at the Heaven gates It aint never late in the game Satan remains With a grudge to see slugs break through my frames My heart aches with the pain and life limits breath We got to have fun now theres only minutes left And in death cause stress youngins is sucked in To get tats for my fallen homies I aint got enough skin Miss yall They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know that we gon have fun In this life cause you only get one When God call for me dont cry I just went home When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasnt wise That crashed and the driver died my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed And Im surprised by the look of that ride that the other two survived Nine months later another one dies Somebody shot him in his side when he was starting up his ride Three years go by I made a hell of a run And thats when Funky got done Joey playing with guns And Tookie over funds Cardie was my man And Reggie I wish that I was with you in that van And Bugz if it wasnt for you You know I wouldnt be standing in this booth And thats the truth I miss yall They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know that we gon have fun In this life cause you only get one When God call for me dont cry I just went home They say that the good die young Thats why I think that you should have fun Cause time wont wait for no one When God calls you gotta go home They say the good die young Thats why I know that we gon have fun In this life cause you only get one When God call for me dont cry I just went home Embed

Rescue Me Lyrics So can you rescue me Because my ship is sinking And Im drowning at sea So can you rescue me from me Can you rescue me I was losing my mind like I was trying to lose it Using my time for using abusing my grind This is my own honest view of who I am behind this music Ryan the whole bottle of patron Connaisseur At a point in time I thought I blew it doing crime I wouldve washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid And my momma knew it she saw especially right through it That I wasnt protected cause peer pressure just be like But I couldnt fight through it the beef started The streets caught up at least we didnt get involved in deceased orders Its Slaughterhouse cause Shady me Porter Sat it down and made peace over Porterhouse and Piesporter Some stupid bitch done turned my girl against me Shouldve tattooed the earth on my arm feel like the world against me Soon as I pa raded here come the rain falling the name calling From the cous I never met with his hand out like Im straight balling Feel like I knocked the ball in Every time I shoot a move I literally cant call it Am I afraid of success Let me think on it I just got nervous let me drink on it Think I just answered yes but not on purpose I pass the church and do the Father Son and Holy Spirit But Im only near it man I need the pastors service Im drowning cause Im so tired of treading So Lord when you get a second please So can you rescue me Because my ship is sinking And Im drowning at sea So can you rescue me from me Can you rescue me I wake up and my shirt is leaking covered in sweat Im dreaming of being murdered when Im sleeping Picture a person beefing with himself And its even worse when Im drinking It hurts when Im thinking me versus my personal demons Im reaching for my nine If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screaming in my mind And if I go to the other side Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her youngun thugging son alive Plus my daughters them my butterflies tell my son that I love him Tell my nieces and nephews their uncle tried To take this music to the fucking peak But Im still a drug dealer as we fucking speak thats fucking weak Behind the tours and rap fans hospitals and cat scans Shoulder when they call him bipolar happiest mad man Dont know my story my struggle the demons that I combat Or how Im starin at them waiting for eye contact beyond that I got a soul mate thats naive so the thought of me is prison to her Baby momma thats crazy and a ten year old who listens to her My fam and friends think Im the bank And the way they keep coming back you think Id got thanked To you its a dream to me its labor these arent monsters these my neighbors And we watch each others back I guess its favor for a favor Sometimes they even save me when my wrist is to that razor so So can you rescue me Because my ship is sinking And Im drowning at sea So can you rescue me from me Can you rescue me Embed

Verses Lyrics Its like this and like that and like this Its like this and like that and like this Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless patrolling corners Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters Im meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse And aint shit changed but kept the same mind state Since the third time that I failed th grade You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind you and a friend Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again Shit why not Blow your brain out Im blowing mine out Fuck it you only live once you might as well die now Its only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord Warlord of rap thatll bash you with a by board And smash into your Honda Accord with a door Ford But Im more towards droppin an acappella thatll chop a fella To Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing Developing anorexia while Im standing next to ya Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet Pumping you full of drugs pull the plugs On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given A less than percent chance of living Have a possible placement its a hospital patient Storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement Doctor Kevorkian has arrived To perform an autopsy on you while you scream Im still alive Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp And pulling your Adams apple out through your mouth Better call the fire department Ive hired an arson To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment Im a liar to start shit Got your bitch wrapped around my dick So tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with Motherfucker Slim Shady bitch Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg Go to bed with the keg wake up with the Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula D Fuck an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead No more said case closed end of discussion Im blowing up like spontaneous human combustion Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas Cross the bombers We blowing up your house killing your parents And coming back to get your foster mommas And Im as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus Cause I aint making no more threats Im doing drive bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets Im more or less sick in the head Maybe more cause I smoked crack today yesterday and the day before Saboteur walk the block with a Labrador Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador Foul style galore verbal cow manure Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B Sure Motherfucker Embed

Bad Guys Always Die Lyrics The Wild ha ha The Wild West Ha ride All you see is the sun reflectin off of the gun Ready for the showdown to go down at one Sweat on my brow lets settle it now Ima show you how real cowboys get down Im polishin gold waitin for this drama to unfold I got a blunt rolled Feelin bold gangstas blood runs cold Its time to reload this old colt The winds gusty its hot muggy and dusty Bust a couple shots make sure Im not rusty Its past noon he should be here soon Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs Sounds like a thousand wolves I cock back put the toast in the holster and froze I pose like a poster hes closer than close I hold the heat sturdy I heard he fights dirty But Ima put inside him and leave early And just when I went to fill him with hot lead I put the gun to his head and this is what he said You never met me youll probably never see me again But I know you the names Slim you want revenge Then dont shoot Im in the same boots as you Im telling the truth I got a price on my head too Cause when you You ride like a cowboy toward the sun And life aint fun when youre on the run Got your gold and you got your gun But life as an outlaw just begun Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride til there aint no place to hide Its sad cause the bad guys always die He was shady I seen by the look on his face He said Take ten paces shit I took eight Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain My shit went bang but it only fired a blank he said You need bullets hurry up run I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs We both drew at the same time and stood stunned Go ahead shoot me but Im not the one you want I figured he was tellin the truth thats why I didnt shoot So what we gon do Its on you Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two And plus I know whos got it Who Some old dude whos got plaques And he already sold two Loaded up my saddle got ready for battle Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel We rolled two miles until we hit the spot An old ghost town that everybody forgot A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot Slim grabbed the shotgun Dre heres the plot This is the spot they call him Doc Loveless Hes going around saying he took the game from us Lets shoot him in his kneecaps hell never see it comin He aint got no legs they cut them off at the stomach Hes got mechanical legs he spins webs Plus hes well respected by the hip hop heads Our mission is to get him to stop layin eggs And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps I drew two guns spun them on my fingers Kicked the swingin doors in started gun slingin I could hear somebody singin it sounded like a G Thang And a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringin I said Its Dres day and started to spray Its he pulls a AK Hollow tips started flyin every which way Thats when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge I fired the first shot spun his body around He hit the ground and landed upside down Dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold I grabbed two girlies and a blunt thats rolled You ride like a cowboy toward the sun And life aint fun when youre on the run Got your gold and you got your gun The life as an outlaw just begun Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride til there aint no place to hide Its sad cause the bad guys always die You ride like a cowboy toward the sun And life aint fun when youre on the run Got your gold and you got your gun But life as an outlaw just begun Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride til there aint no place to hide Its sad cause the bad guys always die The Wild ha ha The Wild West Ha ha ride ha Embed

When the booger sugar took a light dose Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor With the white folks in the window like a psycho Puttin the perfect play together maestro And since its so cold in the D if you dont come to see me You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go Had a lil homie run up on him with a knife though Aiight ho watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle Who might go loco and shoot for nothin Will go postal with you for somethin And Im willin to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city Ask around and they all know Tricky Still pull it together for the kitty Pour a little liquor for Biggie And Frank Nitti on the Mickey send em to Diddy Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt Switch a mans past from the revolt Touchin mothafuckas with the remote Think your man sleepin out here but nigga please he woke Tell em if they want it they can come get that I swear I love my city I just want a little See me they salute me they aint ready for

city I just want a little See me they salute me they aint ready for that Detroit vs Everybody Let the celebration kick off This that point in the party where that person start pointin That pistol because theyre pissed off Shots lick off fire spit off This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off The map these rappers that recite raps We dont believe em like that Deadbeat dad sayin that hell be right back But city thats rough and looked at as them black sheeps With them rap sheets thats long as track meets So lets take a stroll come follow me down these back streets Where blacks and the trap meet Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes But them dreams got put in the back seat And makin fast funds the shotgun Got some homies thats still in the hood life finna twirl They ask me what is it like to see the rest of the world Away from the block away from the gutter All they know is the blocks and watchin for cops undercover So what you have here some niggas thats never had a fear they couldnt face Tougher than Laimbeer in the paint Posted Chuck D coachin never laid up City soil that made us mile with the players Puritan and PA ers where the bullets strayin Fenkell where the bodies layin th mile where them hollows sprayin Woodward where they aint playin Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM Gratiot where grandmas stayin Neighborhood thats decayin Niggas pockets is light so that light bill theyre never payin So fam dont let your lips talk that could be your pitfall And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls Dudes watchin waitin for you to get sloppy Like a hitman lurkin in the shadows with his shotty Out here screamin Lets go yeah my nigga X know City where the TECs blow but we aint talkin techno Tell em if they want it they can come get that I swear I love my city I just want a little See me they salute me they aint ready for that Detroit vs Everybody Im stumblin in my Detroit fitted

minks just to show we stuntin Brother you know its nothin Nigga Im Coleman Youngin tell em Tell em if they want it they can come get that I swear I love my city I just want a little See me they salute me they aint ready for that Detroit vs Everybody Im from the west side blocks where we roll in spots And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch Young niggas gettin popped cause of the clique they claim And in most homicides its a bitch to blame My future plans to stay froze til my wrist complains If rap fails Im whippin coke til the brick complains In the new switchin lanes probably with big kis Aint talkin coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be You see that D right above where my lid be Cant trust a soul well thats how these streets did me I bossed up from setbacks by luck I rep that Aint scared of niggas shit Im from Detroit I expect that Look Im from Detroit bitch Where we crack heads and we break bails Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales Dreaming of a rollie a coupe a crib off of lake trails They quick to take a trip with so much weight that itd break scales Young boys wilding with a chopper theyll make hail Screaming fuck the cops and quick to pop off like some fake nails Shout out to my strippers with inches and fake tails And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale Holla if you need it I got it just come and ask the man Try me and get cheddar on your head just like a Packer fan Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan Nobody I can call on its ball or get balled on Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong Its Mile till I die raised by some street niggas Fuck friends aint got none Im dolo with this heat nigga Boogers in my watch face my wrists be looking slimy Once I fuck shes like my seatbelt I put that bitch behind me nigga Tell em if they want it they can come get that I swear I love my city I just want a little See me they salute me they aint ready for that Detroit vs Everybody My timing was perfect designed to be worshiped Like Jesus as a fetus Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas Needless to say Im the sniper Pick us off niggas soft While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher Im from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street Home of the big three big cuffs big guns big chips Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips Im from the city where the bitches even gangster Suck a nigga dick get her robbed tell em thank you We dont fuck with you outsiders learn who to talk to Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you

Minute Freestyle Lyrics Ill shove a gun in your grill greasy and heated Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you its easy to eat it You need to be immediately treated While youre breathing And youll be leaving the receiving room this evening with Jesus You hate on us Well be waiting on eight corners Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders Ill hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat Floating around drowned faced down in a boat Ill pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull up to the Seven Mile drive through At McDonalds and pile drive you I got the power to snatch a driver out of his Eddie Bauer When it drives by me at miles an hour This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out Cause yall cant see me like Mases eyebrows Walking in swamp water with an M out for the blood Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug To break braces you say grace and make faces Ill display hate and break you in eight places Take paces turn around draw in a standoff Precise aim ice in my veins blowing your hand off Dancing with the Devil leading I wont die Im never leaving I pledge allegiance to forever breathing Street niggas with nuts what My meats bigger Fake ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers With a deathwish thinking Im the nigga to mess with Let the tech lift direct chest hit melt your necklace For instance you just a henchmen on tough soil A follower never had heart he just loyal Thugs is glass doors I see through them put the heat to them Be careful you might get what you ask for Thats what you false ballers get mugged and gagged for Your life flashing in front of your eyes in fast forward Dearly departed I dont even listen to artists Im pissing the farthest and Im also hitting the hardest Im very intelligent Compare me to cameras I flash and shoot what I see and steady developing I fly you out of your whip with one try of the trigger Out of your clique aint one nigga out of his shit You gotta be kidding bring all of them niggas They all gotta be hit quick and they all gotta be hitten Its not a game and I aint playing Yo if I aint lived it did it or seen it then I aint saying I put a hole right in your chest Stick a knife in your soul Then take your life after taking your death Im nice That aint even counting the endless bars Friends with scars wondering which Benz is ours Pretending to ball could even be the ending of yall The minute you fall my criminals will finish you off I argue with no one You got a gun Alright show one If you aint got heart now you aint gon just grow one Im keeping it raw illegal like Malik and Jamal Cause I dont believe in the law like Im Steven Seagal Flipping off the police while Im leaping a wall Take a bunch of Tylenol then fall asleep in a mall I got your little son youll be receiving a call Youre lucky this little punks still breathing at all Fuck the world this how I get even at yall Pop shit get rolled up and leave in a ball I hit you in your mouth and sink your teeth in your jaws You wont be able to eat shit not even a malt This lethal assault is giving you a reason to stall Im cocking this deuce deuce and Im squeezing it off At the first burp and a fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough Get your arm chewed off like you was teasing a dog Im cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw Ill kick my girl out in degrees in her bra Im gonna give it to you straight this time Lace this bong Bring it to your face until the Jakes respond Guard yall shit I dont care how hard yall hit I got cats with bats you wouldnt play hardball with I splatter intestines quick before you can blast Or handle your weapon youll get stabbed in a matter of seconds We aint worried about threats cause God got us We popping Cris yall sipping Moet by products I aint scared to die lets blast its gonna be either If you both die then your casket is gonna be deeper Yo you aint a Don You dont even know what beef is What you competing with our hittin make concrete give Yo I came out Naked at birth making it worse Making a verse sacred and shaking the Earth Niggas got plenty opinions about Royce But they aint got a voice Im doper than them so they aint got a choice Niggas be playing battle battle Not understanding themselves They babble babble thats why they stay on the shelves Playing yourself Im promising threats to test yall Keep doing this rap shit until UPS calls I see why you must hate me Im sharp enough to cut gravy Its just crazy niggas is such babies Real as they come dancing Killing for fun advancing Healing my thumb killing for fun Cock squeeze and make every nigga freeze in here Stop breathing there better be some cheese in here If theres any MCs in here I hope you read me clear You seeing peace beef with the Cs in here Yo you aint fly I got shit that you cant buy You cant lie you drink St Ides and fake high Take pie try to flip it You dont nothing about that shit If was you I wouldnt risk it I wouldnt risk it Rappers get hit with this verbal biscuit Hey yo yo yo yo yo Keep the same beat keep the same beat keep the same beat It goes like this yo My attitude is worse than N W A s was Ill battle you over stupid shit and diss people Who aint have shit to do with it like Cool J does You see me standing outside of your building screaming Puffy is good but Slim Shady is for the children I look at my life in a new light fuck it Give me two mics I write songs for me fuck what you like Youre probably hear me rap half hearted cause I dont like rap anyway Im just trying to get my porno career started Every place and event Shit Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went Want a deal Study these chapters Lesson one Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers Lesson two Face em and diss em Dont give em a demo kidnap em And make em come to your basement and listen Lesson three Get a job at a label switch demos with Canibus And put yours on the owners table Lesson four Know you heard this before Hey let me get your number Ill call you tomorrow for sure Dont act like a fan you wanna get signed Get the whitest A R you can find Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can Lesson five Get a hook up at Jive Dress up like I C P and have them come see you perform live And thats the key but when you see me on the street I aint Givin you shit bitch dont even bother asking me Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when Im spitting Cause Im always shitting when Im rapping like Master P Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth My balls broke both of her collarbones Told Mya this shit was all about me ah Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis mono and gonorrhea And all three of my main girls said see ya Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah I splish splash while Im taking a bath Grab a handful of pills break em in half take em and laugh White trash fucking your wife in the ass While youre out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass And its like that and its like that It dont stop Slim Shady yo The rap auctioneer spitting out double figures For fans to repeat handling heat The Commander in Chief I shouldve been banned from the streets Flee after I stab an MC with twin crutches Youve been had by the phantom of beef Release when the paper and pen touches While yall talking My venomous rap splits Get your ass kicked punk Your kind get offed often niggas deep with heat at the mall walking Youll either get shot with all barkers Or get knocked upside your head with big blocks Till you spit teeth Youre all soft and up shits creek in a long coffin I get work without a single fiend involved Im married to the mob I mean for real ring and all Basically that means I aint your average rap nigga Youll get slapped and thrown in the back of an Ac bigger With the latch cracked trunk open So you can look up at the stars Fill your pockets with plastic explosives Drive to cover detonate the bomb Blow you up with the car and flee the scene to cop another Morph right into the physical form of your spirit In front of your eyes and make you battle yourself Like Shang Tsung with wisdom in the brilliance of a million disciples Equipped with a right hook to split a building The pure repper of the African race Sent here to knock you off your square and put you back in your place Babylon battalion holding your engineer ransom For your master so I can sabotage your album Yo weed lacer burgundy Blazer Wanted for burglary had to ditch the Mercury Tracer I m on some loc shit some fed up with the being broke shit I m not to joke with bitch I don t sell crack I smoke it Having a coke fit going through withdrawls daily Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie My brain s dusted I m disgusted at all my habits Too many aspirin tablets empty medicine cabinets Losing battles to wack rappers cause I m always too blunted Walking up in the cypher smoking talking about Who want it Thug and a crook every drug in the book I ve done it My s at your brain is that you chain Run it Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor Aggressive nature got me sticking you for your Progressive pager Spectacular crystal meth manufacturer Stole your momma s Acura wrecked it and sold it back to her Boosting Nike jackets escaped from psychiatrics Told the nurse to save my bed for me I might be back bitch So barricade your entrance put up some extra fences A woman beater wanted for repeated sex offenses Chasing dips take them on long vacation trips Kidnapping em and trapping em in abusive relationships Fuck up your face and lips slit your stomach and watch your gut split Cut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with Mama don t you cry your son is too far gone I m so high I don t even know what label I m on I m fucked up I feel just like an overworked plumber I m sick of this shit what s Dr Kevorkian s phone number Its like this right Bust it You get laced by the gun in case you try to run Hatred on my face by the tongue get baked by the sun Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal Topping levels of combustion thats hot enough to stop the devil Innovative flusher to enemies The impact will be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees Black poised since birth Birth Tore the womb up To hit the Earth like an asteroid and blow the moon up Trust me Im the epitome you better bust me Any nigga can say fuck me and he gon touch me Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava Man this is hot Im out of my shit From the bottom I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top Raw thats what I came out here for To raise and eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store And switch up the breed of MC to stick a bitch up Bigger and speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up Im fly against all laws of gravitation I crushed all yall now you want a collaboration But fuck that you stepped up so Im gonna fuck your rep up Tear the rest up with every joint that I press up Handling heat and ammo bullets passing me by Challenging me to battle Man you asking to die Narrow off niggas squeeze a grenade until its dissolved Bite the barrel of a revolver and spin it Nigga forget it I earned it I kill you then come to your funeral and strangle you to confirm it Minds carry malaria sick Ask niggas who the best is youll hear in every area Crushing your head hunting you dead You aint nice I battled you before I dont remember nothing you said You was wack I was gonna quit on it till I thought My dick is big enough for all of yall niggas to get on it Making you high off of the smoke often youre cold Making yall join that big hip hop nation in the sky And its easy believe me you better have been fronting When you said you was hot cause you couldnt please me if you was begging me Some people say Im strange I tell them aint shit change Im still the same lame asshole with a different name Who came late to the last show with a different dame Brain ate from the last O that I sniffed of cane You know youre spaced the fuck out like George Lucas When your puke is turning to yellowish orange mucus So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers Im not a rapper Im a demon who speaks English Freak genius too extreme for the weak and squeemish Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished Cause when I drop the science motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence Start a fire and block the hydrants Im just a mean person you never seen worse than So when Slim gets this M bursting You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing On the B side of my first single with the clean version Stopping your short life when you still a teen virgin Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally Ill take it back before we knew each others name Run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame Ill take it further back than that Back to Lovers Lane to the night you were thought of And cock block your fathers game Ill plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle And when Im down with ten seconds left in the whole bout Im gonna throw a head butt so hard itll knock us both out Embed

Em Rapcity Backroom Freestyle Lyrics Yea Yall know what it is Rap City presents Em Slaughterhouse Eminem Big Tigg Just Blaze On the s and s oh oh Yo Tigg get in the not booth And spit the truth to the young youth Aight ay Amex dont leave home without your cards But this Hip Hop so dont leave home without your bars And for some of these rap stars thats just too bad Cause you cant bring out them bars that you aint never had Its Eminem and Slaughterhouse yeah you know we the truth And ohh the game is out of order since we closed the booth Yes indeed original beats the replacement cause The back room will never be what the basement was Im the realest mofucker that I know Wasnt always the case guess the figure had to grow I do it for the love I dont do it for the dough But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes Whats sad is I couldnt tell you what Im hated for And them painkillers didnt murder the pain they gave me more These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe I grew up mature yall cant see that this the old Joe Want to see me lose every battle of depression No matter what it do to me no matter my regression They want to see me fall want to ruin my regiment from the start Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart Id be the first to admit it lost focus for a while Sendin unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks Was so high I lost track of my ways Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age The way she act and behave was it an act or a phase How you trife when I gave you life You was lacking in wage You dont want say hi or speak to me Bet you makin dollars by weekly Try to help the world out bring some reparation And forget being humble in a state of desperation Aint gotta ask what to help with no hesitation And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation I love you but its best we stay apart segregation And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication Trust me I dont never want to see that side of Joe It would kill us all slow one reason Im the realest mother mother I know Its Nickle riding round in that Maserati four seat Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Starks goatee Best rapper alive and you know me The most distinguished shooter thats coming up out of the D since Joe D I take mines at lead point At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint Hip hop is alive but the rhymes died Only fear I have is world star being yelled from my blind side Dont get me wrong it aint like I aint never lost a fight But these days Im more like a lyrical artiste Im outlining everybody in chalk white The off beat deceased version of Dr Narcisse This aint blueprint your idolizing You tryna jump fast thats foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilots license Thats plain stupid your boys a star Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar Its ironic I remember when I couldnt afford a car And now its back and forth The black one or white one I call em Macklemore And Lord Jamar first we defyin the odds We not a group we more like a circular firing squad This not a booth this is our house and we wont stop We killed the cypher two times already What you gon give us an award But we wont stop for shutting down the internet Now tell ya momma hi and tell Rihanna we aint finished yet When we step in that booth thats when the flame enters Best spit make any set trip yeah its the gang members Waving that shady flag navy jag Matching the yank fit with the polo brief showing due to the lazy sag Im in a crazy kind of place I got this thing right on my waist thatll leave tears on your baby mommas face So chill Im in a crazy kind of place I got this thing below my waist Thatll leave kids on your baby mommas face for real The flow gets cracked as it came in capsules Your cap just started snapping My starter caps was snapping When cross color was cracking And my cane was half full With the half moon park hope you rap dudes smart Dont piss me off like the bathroom mop You dont want it with me If Im throwing hooks at you that dont mean the chorus for free So save your jabs its way better If I start throwing jabs Im talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather Yeah Im a crook from the brook that mastered how niggas shook turned notebook Broke cook Im so dope look Bring the beat back with no hook just bars Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop make em open up their bras Move g strings like guitars thats nothing thats something light Like Riesling at the bar Y A O W A if yall aint saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say This like NWO vs NWA yall like the rockers versus the ROC Full of nothing but Jays Check the rocks its nothing fugaz But dont get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days Make it horny when we out Amityville horror yall dont want it with the house Slaughter season yall the reason Real dudes Im bringing some more in Like a Polynesian Sick with the llama squeezing Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing Got your body and legs torn but before you was airborne You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos is weezing They set you deep in your coffin sleeping Im gone off the deep end Im a wolf this industry my sheep skin Im out here hunting with my ink pen Im living like a kingpin Doing it for my gs in the pen Dreaming about two piecing a police chiefs chin You rappers something candy coated I dont like suckers Im Iron Mike I dont like Busters You looking for em fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur You got the Wright brothers No bright jeans no bright colors Im the second coming the one that Pac predicted Islamic Gnostic and Christian the flow so godly you got to listen I backed you in a dodge a minute Like MC Eiht in a L A hat these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace Im looking at your videos look like your watching tennis Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens I guess that eras over man hold on Im splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em I give em different patterns they didnt fathom they stealing my styles Before me you didnt have em You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script Too many punchlines Family Im amongst mine I keep the peace like a monks mind fade your favorite barber Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara Dont stop what we doing When you see L A your team will be ruined This game need a new villain Im the kind to murder you on vine ooh kill em Ladies and gentlemen Now introducing the man the myth the legend Mister Marshall Mathers AKA Slim Shady Ayo can we cut this beat off I might need to do this acapella yo Role model Ill roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of Coke products If she dont swallow and tie her to the bumper hit the throttle While Im tryna hit the potholes Ill freaking take Madonna to McDonalds Any holl end up horizontal gettin fondled I dont cuddle I dont coddle Only motto that I follows everything I drive whether its a Navajo or a Tahoe Its got a ho in it Nah ho I dont got no freaking bronco You looking for a buck get a horse fuck Tonto I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo And a box of condoms little blond ho Fuck me Fuck you too like Im at Bonnaroo booing Bono And I aint from this planet so nanu nana nanu Im intolerable too volatile screw it I dont gotta make the honor roll to be on a roll I dont know much what I do know I do it pronto though So knock it off all these knock off mes The last thing the world needs is another me But if you think this is part two to Recovery Or Love the Way You Lie part twelve Or something heart felt you bout to make a discovery Like you found Christopher Columbus compass Aint dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers so suck it I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach That punctured a lung punk and Im still functioning from it Chump It was nothing Now watch while I fuckin one up it and toot my own horn Once I think of something to trump it And I dont need a fucking instrument to sound off Like the trunk of an elephant the triumphant Return of the ether spitting retard reborn But chances of you having another re birth slim to none Like a skinny Mother Teresa give a fuck if its Easter so kiss my keister Cause thats the only thing Ill turn the other cheek for Embed

Desperados Lyrics Yo ayo turn the heads up and the mics up We got the Dreadknaughts yknahmsayin Super MC yknahmean Bugz Dirty and all that All that shit yknahmsayin Desperados with the cars Eminem Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Til it went over the bridge Jumped out and dove in the ditch Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids Ima go for your mids heres a body blow for your ribs While youre clutchin your stomach And bleedin all over your bitch I know where you live your girl showed me your crib Unless she told me a fib then Ima have both of you did Burning incense facin a murder sentence Under intense investigation for killin infants While I sit in padded rooms doin shrooms Havin visions of dead pregnant women With brooms jabbed in they wombs Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up Stickin up Arbor Drugs and jumpin in garbage trucks Im from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps Give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch See me every summer layin up against the dumpster With a hundred dollar jumper smothered in Southern Comfort Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mothers bumper She came home screamin a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her Ayo proceed to list em theres no need to diss em Down here we heat em destroy your whole breathing system Twist em like beer caps once they hear that Rap murder rates and I snap vertebrates Collapse further states my track preserve the great Your pack deserve a crate in fact the word is fate Ill kill you slow like AIDS infested nuts Im holdin vendetta like seven great molested sluts Callin me a bitch nigga you need to stop Reality one on one how many times you got dropped Im cut throat when any track runs Conscious when I smack nuns The rough neck that make Muslims run and pack guns Im volcanic the sermon preacher Burnin emcees most wanted by Herman Kiefer You tried to get a squad they was like Money oh no Leave you brain dead hittin trees with Sonny Bono I kick without a dojo D slow flow Shoot down your mothership and pimp smack mojo No pro wanna go knuckle blades with the renegade Nigga tried to go pop and plus they minute made My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow Big P the reason emcees cancelled they show The truth will hurt seein Proof at work no shame in it The best part of your show is when you put my name in it My squad be godly fearin shit hardly So I hope when Ima die dope like Chris Farley Fuck that Who run shit once these drums hit You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit Heres a can of asswhip for you to come get Your click made they trip I make them hoes suck mint Ask your girl they know the scoop dont fuck with Bugz bitch Ill chop off her titty have you suckin

It Has Been Said Lyrics It has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed Over bread men who have bled to death dead Strapped to beds pipe bombs dynamite lead Money power respect street cred yeah Its scary aint it Picture yourself going out as a hero Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners Fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners Notorious tried to warn us We watched so many piggybacked off of Biggies back and Pacs landmarks history in rap Statistically in fact its so sad to see us re enact These tragic events which lead us back To where we left off on March th To come from such hard knock lives And make it up out of em hit the spotlights And once theyre on us this is our lives Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us To see who can last the longest And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest In this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from Its origin which is usually originated from cats who starving Or it could just be somebodys aura that just horri fies And applies to his persona or the sizes In his entou rage that intimidates the people To the point that you know that hes gangster He aint just say shit you just believe it Since B I G taught us niggas to think big Im been about my business since then so anxious It aint how we live its what he said he did it for Brooklyn This I took in sent chills through my skin Vicious Im experiencing the same sights as him Its what excited Obie to write these poems Rolling going through the same shit he spoken Open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life Palming that forty five plotting to pop my mind Then that crooked eye Jamaican Id so many times rewind Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind Get up out the system who could give him better signs No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes So possibly Id be popular huh Thats the inspiration I got from my nigga B I I took him from coal to diamond I molded his mind Into the most phenomenal artist of any and all time I made a Frankenstein my design impressed Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess Critics lashed said I made a fortune off of his passing All I did was build a dynasty off of his passion And Im addressing the adolescents absent to who he is The original king of New York Christopher Wallace This is a promise on Diddys honor Im a father TYanna And teach her that with all the drama dont even bother On repeat all of your albums play back to back And I visit your grave cause our friendships intact An immaculate concept extravagant progress Bullet wounds left in my heart Im yelling God bless Regardless to critics yelling that East West I seen the game losing Im just pressing the reset And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally Ima pay homage Brooklyns finest Whether its Queens or Harlem itll be instant stardom nigga Embed

Welcome To Planet X Lyrics I live in a world thats different than your world Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy Those things dont exist in my world anymore Welcome to my world Welcome to Planet X motherfucker It used to be parks Used to be jungle gyms Now they just stories passed down orally from my great grandmother Nem It used to be public pools Kids loved to swim til the summers end Now its enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter You can blame the government Let me tell you how it all started The middle class was evaporated then the filthy rich couldnt stand the stench of the dirt Poor of course who had the world oversaturated So a new world order was activated No more black no more white no more brown no more yellow no more red Just high born citizens and low born citizens And all that race shit was eradicated Youre either rich or youre poor now Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now Being poor is like fighting a war now No energy to fight the real enemy because youre worn out Living life on a tight rope but the trickery is the tight rope Its slippery as a ice slope Every second somebody is falling off So we figure we embrace the misery Nigga we never liked hope Cause hope was the buzzword That they used to brainwash us fuck that we unlearn Now the rich people concerned Cause they know our return is confirmed by holding a gun firm Whats that in the distance You fucked slums raw til they gave birth to a resistance You scared looking at your window You see your own fucking children crawling over your fences One by one they all come slow to meet their fates And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves And three by three theyve come at me their guns and swords were drawn Now four by four before the Lord theyll choose a witchy spawn Cause were coming for you La la la la la were coming for you La la la la la were coming for you Yo what you gon do now Its too late for talking Im in your face with the tool out Foot wearing the other shoe now The chickens came home to roost now Who got the juice now Aye yo what you gon do now You want the truce now Im in your face with the tool out Foot wearing the other shoe now The chickens came home to roost now Who got the juice now Oil addiction water pollution Soil contamination and over consumption Wiped out two thirds of the planets fresh water And crop reserves creating a vast wasteland on a global scale One by one they all come slow to meet their fates And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves And three by three theyve come at me their guns and swords were drawn Now four by four before the Lord theyll choose a witchy spawn Cause were coming for you La la la la la were coming for you Embed

Hazardous Youth Lyrics Its like this and like that and like this Im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners Lookin for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters Im meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Senior And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse And aint shit changed I kept the same mind state Since the third time that I failed ninth grade You probably think that Im a negative person Dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death As I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind You and a friend can jump off of a bridge And if you live do it again Shit why not Blow your brain out Im blowin mine out Fuck it you only live once you might as well die now Embed

Turn Me Loose Lyrics Uh Aiight Check Slim Shady through the mic kid Uh Slim Shady Oh I dont do black music I dont do white music I make fight music for high school kids I put lives at risk when I drive like this From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts So I get pissed and cant pick which wrist to slit Little rich kids in cribs dont attempt this shit So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch So I say to the girl Im like What up girl Shut up girl Then I showed her a cut up squirrel She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer I moved on to two blondes kissin on a futon Yo baby what are you on I looked at em both and I was like Look Check this out toots Im lookin for Cookie Puss I need to speak to him immediately They played my video on MTV last week And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some Here comes Fred Durst Now Shady let me get some Who knows what galaxy I came from One where a bass drum hung from my high chair Now Im a nightmare you stay right there I got the fever for the flavor of a single See me and Shady I think we got it locked down Shocked by the sound I got you crusin with your top down These two blondes I offered them both a drink And this you would think could get the party started But instead the girls turned their heads Opened up their mouth smelled like somebody farted So it was time for me to move on Shady said the living room was a dance floor So turn me loose I was cuttin the rug with this chick Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me wow I spilled a drink on his shirt But no he insisted we should go And before I could drop him Shady had to clock him The music stopped the party stood in shock I looked around grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf Turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose This partys going my way Or no way at all Why dont you Turn me loose You better tell them to come reshingle the roof Cause just keep giving me free drinks til I puke Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group Im sitting at the bar and Im not being approached Cause Freds over there stealing all of my hoes Yo Fred save me some I walked to these siamese twins And asked to have a threesome I told them two heads are better than one Plus I respect how yall roll together as one Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin Stood up like Wait where are you goin Well three strikes and Im out And I just struck out two times in a row I aint trying no more fuck it Im chillin Did a shot of J ger fell asleep on the ceiling Who knows what galaxy I came from One where a bass drum hung from my high chair Now Im a nightmare you stay right there I got the fever for the flavor of a single See me and Shady I think we got it locked down Shocked by the sound I got you crusin with your top down These two blondes I offered them both a drink And this you would think could get the party started But instead the girls turned their heads Opened up their mouth smelled like somebody farted So it was time for me to move on Shady said the living room was a dance floor So turn me loose I was cuttin the rug with this chick Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me wow I spilled a drink on his shirt But no he insisted we should go And before I could drop him Shady had to clock him The music stopped the party stood in shock I looked around grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf Turn me loose Turn me loose Turn me loose This partys going my way Or no way at all Why dont you Embed

Perspective Lyrics But you got people of all races Like coming together and and Helping shape this from the ground up So now you got little white kids growin up with black idols And you got black kids growin up with white idols And you got it its just this whole mixing pot Nothing has brought more races and more people From all different walks of life together than hip hop No music has done that I dont think anything has done that as much as hip hop has So in the same token I can understand the frustration being that you know Damn near every form of of music period was created by black people So you got Chuck Berry you got Rosetta Tharpe And rock n roll is starting to get some attention but then along comes Elvis And people are acting like Oh my God Ive never seen this before Youve seen it before but you might not have seen a white person do it to this level So now he sells the most records and people are callin him the king of rock n roll right But on the flip side of the coin If Im a black kid growin up in lets say the s s s whatever right And Im lookin on TV and nobody looks like me And its very stereotypical And Im lookin at fuckin Im lookin at toys And theyre and everything is white The fuckin action figures are all white The the fuckin superheroes are all white Like maybe theres one or two uh black superheroes mixed in there with mostly white I dont know how Id grow up and not have a chip on my shoulder On the other flip side of that coin We dont get to choose our parents we dont get to choose what color were born Its more about at that point it becomes Youre born here you are youre what color you are youre what nationality you are And then its what you do with it right To make a difference To make a difference To make a To make a difference Embed

that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind you and a friend Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again Pfft why not Blow your brain out Im blowin mine out Forget it you only live once you might as well die now Yeah best the way it is Roll your tape recorders we came to the London borders Walk in a caster store put on a master score Blast your four then I trash your store Your woman start to scream

Pooh Butt Day Lyrics Huh huh huh huh Oh yeah The Pooh Butt Day One of those sticky type of things to upon Check it out Get up this morning Im feeling sleepy as all hell Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell All the way downstairs and onto the couch And I pissed my pants on the way down South So I went back upstairs to change my underwear Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair Finally got unzipped I went to put em down the street But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said Pew Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair Went to rinse it out but then the water wasnt there That damn toilet it musta went foul Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel Went to get my clothes but I couldnt wear the wash So I sat and played Super Mario on my Nintendo I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff Man today I just feel like a pooh butt Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Now every single day I make habits to get up But today I just feel like a pooh butt So Ill stay in bed I dont know whats wrong with me Im just taking everything nonchalantly I just feel like I cant move one muscle My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle My plane leaves to roll about quarter to Its looks like Im gonna be late Aw forget that baby said I just cant make it I know youre disappointed but your gonna have to take it Im sick in bed Im making But before I hung up the phone she told me where I could put it Comes next day I got a call from M M he said We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed I said I aint doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck he said Whats up I said I feel like a pooh butt Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Yo you ever have one of those pooie stinky Ridiculous rotten days M M Man I had one once check this out Woke up in the morning yawning Gotta get to the recording studio I gotta get a take done Put all my rhymes together so I can make one Get outta bed fall on my head Slipped on the rug I thought I was dead Cussin I think my head is busted but its really nothing Only a concussion shake it off get off the ground Look around couldnt find my rhyme sheets Whered I put em down They were just there last night on the chair Had to look everywhere but couldnt find em anywhere Go to the basement might of misplaced em Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry Goin down the stairs what could happen next But when its this early you cant skip steps Fallin head first as I fall I curse Things are lookin bad Imma only get worse Achin I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse I cant remember nothing think Ill collapse If you forget the whole thing pause for a second What was I looking for Oh yeah my rhyme sheets they might be on the floor Or on the chair Wait a minute where am I Im in a basement Damn how does time fly Think for a second recall my memory If I was a rhyme sheet where would I be Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket So I woulda never lost em Already Ive only got an hour to eat breakfast Get dressed plus take a shower got undressed Got the zest off the rack Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack Cold as hell started to yell jumped out the shower And said fuck it Ill smell Grabbed the towel off the rack dried off got dressed Still had to eat plus my hair was a mess I was in a rush grabbed the brush And ran right into the door on the floor I land Always to fate now I know Im cursed I think it might help if I open the door first Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist But thats what happens on a day like this Sometimes things just never go my way You know I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I just feel like a pooh butt today Wow that sounds pretty pooie to me Now Im gonna break it down for all the people who dont know what a pooh butt day is Now a pooh butt day is something everybodys had No particular depression neither mad or sad You couldnt see your butt because your butt is what it is Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt Then youre feeling like shit They come up at a certain time they dont have a season But most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason They get a careless attitude the yucky sensations Some people wont accept love in a pooie situation Sittin on the toilet for an hour or so Marks on the butt from the seat on the bowl Grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe When I realize I may have sat the in the seat too tight So I struggle to from a stuck position But removing myself was an impossible mission Screaming to get out I couldnt take it any more When my mother arrived and knocked upon the door We pulled and pulled and I was removed from the seat I couldnt sit down for a whole damn week Never again will I get caught in that rut So I can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh butt Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Well the very next day Felt the pooh butt sick but am I defeated I survived So I went downstairs and managed not to fall Since I was feeling better I get Manix to call Well said Oh says Ey s wzup whut up you gotta go Im feeling pretty good what about if I come over We can practice for a while order the pizza are you sober He said I aint gonna go nope Im not going You wanna know the reason why Im sound like Because I got pneumonia Im something to do but uhm If you could smell the way Im saying youd be saying pew I thought for a second and I said I dont get it Manix said just forget it homes I aint going out in this weather I dont feel like doin nothing but I leavin you too it Dont be comin over feelin cause im feeling like pooh Pooh pooh pooh pooh Pooh pooh pooh pooh Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way I just feel like a pooh butt today Sometimes things just never go my way You know I just feel like a pooh butt today Pooh butt I feel like a pooh butt Sometimes I feel like a pooh butt When you just cant get up When you feel like you want to stay in bed all day Thats an example of a pooh but day Ooooooh pooh butt oh My example of a pooh butt day Is when you have a foot falls asleep for the whole day But youve got a track run at one oclock You know what pisses me off is when we get all the parts down except James gets a lag on his throat and he fucks up and you know what else pisses me off is whatevers pissing me off in that particular moment thats whats usually pissing me off Im gonna end this song by saying uh Pooh buuutt Embed

Our House Lyrics I wanna be the best who ever did it Dont know if that goal is feasible or it isnt But if it is then God if youre listenin Please grant me the strength to crush all competition You cant blame me for dreaming Im a dreamer And if Im coming off brash please forgive me But thats all I want I just wanna be the illest MC The same time being as real as can be Mayhem sickness murder horror These are the kind of words that describe my aura G Rap Ras Kass Kurupt Redman I am cut from that cloth Write a rhyme about me you a dead man Cool J Im Bad video Learned the whole routine and performed it for my fathers friends While they smoked and drank Symphony D O C inspired me to write what Would eventually put me on airplanes like B o B Canibus Wu Tang you know our history but hats off When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk Thank God for the one two cadence Thank God for the lunchroom tables Im trying to be the sickest nigga dead or alive And if I happen to fall short its been one hell of a ride Chronic and looking up at the sky at the sun Up until the day the sun is you You listening to hip hop you in Jays house Waynes house Nas house Ems house Our House So welcome to our house Where no one comes back out You wont find comfort In here in here in here When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter It started off wack But in the words of a ten year old my shit was getting phatter I hit the studio at stupid ill Not knowing how the booth would feel whats ADATs and two inch reel How you ad lib Whats a punch I aint a boxer But I sure enough learned the ropes look D and Mike you made a monster Now everydays a game of Contra I got men An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen This is my dream dont fuck with it Im telling you Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available Im disgusted as a fan look how niggas sounding damn Weak head yall suck bad fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan Im finna to be the best in this profession Ive been invested all my life so wipe your feet before you step in Our house So welcome to our house Where no one comes back out You wont find comfort In here in here in here I wanna be the best who ever did it Dont know if that goal is feasible or it isnt But if it is then God if youre listenin Please grant me the strength to crush all competition You cant blame me for dreaming Im a dreamer And if Im coming off brash please forgive me But thats all I want I just wan be the illest MC Same time bein as real as can be I never wanted a chain that was encrusted I wanted to be respected amongst my peers and to be trusted Wanted not to be complacent though okay with my regression I was banking hip hop would do away with my depression I wanted to be understood but they never got my deposition I never wanted attention but I lusted recognition Wanted peace with my childs mom wanted to be a better dad Not as a person wanted to give that nigga choices I never had Which honestly kept me alive cause in order for me to give I needed not to be suicidal though it was killing me just to live Wanted to make mother cry and choke her up cause she proud Wanted to marry my dreams so I cheated on fear broke up with my doubts So I got no choice but to succeed and show music that Im capable She the one Im grateful to and Id hate for her To think that Im unfaithful too If she did her soul would bleed But they raised another breed in So welcome to our house Where no one comes back out You wont find comfort In here in here in here Yo in my house the lights out No utilities in the facilities Feeling my lifes bout to wipe out These feelings Im feeling be killing me I pull the mic out cant strike out Cause if winning is really my enemy I pull a nine out blow my mind out Is the end of me really serenity Man in my house its rap or die Get a piece of that apple pie Life is a Pharcyde song and that bitch just passes by So I got lyrically complex that way I could clock checks Get my moms out the projects with these concepts competition cant digest And then I stress cause the road is rough I start feeling like shits sour The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers For ten hours so send cowards The message from Crooked I Royce Da Joe Budden Em Yaowa In our house we spit like Sig Sauers The way I feel now I could spit for six hours Straight only way to be great is to dig down if you can hear this sound in side my head sounds like a fucking drive by Thats what the inside of my minds like Looking back on my career even hindsights tunnel vision mics Never wanted that so bad felt like I could go mad Nomad with a notepad Go Taz spaz on these ho bags That bother me but I never wanna show that Just dont act like it ever does Even though you know that there will never come A day someone blows past you never was Someone whos as dope as you ever was And you hope thats true cause the competitor in you Couldnt let somebody be better than you And you know that so you dont ever hold back What you gonna go back into working a regular job Fuck that Imma go hard grab on my gonads Tell them fuck theyselves They call me a wigger like Renee Zell But I raised hell like a stay at home dad Rap is the only thing that I was ever really bad to the bone at Guess Im similar to gangrene when Im angry then Im Hulk Smash so much passion but no compassion If eyes are the windows to the soul Then its broken glass and theres no trespassing Alright now here we go Dre stamped me now Im stamping Yelawolf Get ready for the most competitive Clique in the world its like Clash Of The Titans I released the cracker its time to set it again And when its said and its all done None shall ever fuck with this squadron So come on in at your own risk This is Bitch So welcome to our house Where no one comes back out You wont find comfort In here in here in here Embed

Zane Lowe BBC Radio Interview Part LyricsZane Lowe Welcome back to Radio One Maida Vale studio here we are Part of the reason were here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio around the corner and youve got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well Eminem Its super exciting to be here I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanyes interview so I decided I was going to walk in here pee on the floor and leave Im peeing right now Alright see you guys later ZL Seeing you with the band and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic it was I dont think Ive ever seen you more alive on the mic It was full of energy and in the moment What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more Are you feeling that way E I think performing has gotten a lot different its gotten better with the band because theres just more elements to it and being it is a live show theres more places you can go with it Theres things you can do with your hands its really cool its different I think its better ZL Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it E I didnt write that I freestyled it off the dome take ZL Absolutely ridiculous I mean the song is ridiculous it doesnt make any sense whatsoever E Thank you ZL When you get to perform that live that must be I saw at the end once you finished that thats a challenge for anybody At the end you must feel like Wow Thats a lot of rhymes to get through its like or minutes non stop E Um Yeah the other night I dont think we did the whole song We did kind of a Deadly Medley ZL I dont even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because its such a stream of consciousness through the whole track E Yeah I dont know I wouldnt even want to begin to think of that because I think it is a stream of consciousness Nice stream of consciousness running down my leg ZL The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world Because in my opinion listening to it now its kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the st record but also what youve been through and what youve learnt over the past or years Its kind of like the combination of the two Is that fair do you think The first album that feels like its slightly grown up but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff E Its grown up and down I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album but at the same time I feel like its kind of a version All my albums I think for the most part pretty much tell where Im at you know at each one at that time period whatever So this is kinda like theres a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time you know And its kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it ZL Settling some scores as well and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that E I mean some stuff yeah But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that the overall vibe of that album Just because it started to go there in the recording process ZL So when did that begin like you were going down that road E I had started making a few records for it and it just sounded like the tonality of it the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way And I figured out what direction it should go in kinda started gearing everything that way And alotta times making an album I dont always have the direction or concept early on Sometimes it doesnt come until the middle towards the end of a record to figure out where Im actually going with that thats just a culmination of songs and depending on what the vibe is Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go lets say Recovery or whatever But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept ZL That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind to piece it together that way E It was but it wasnt in the sense of I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if Im going to call it that I want it to make sense ZL And the stakes are high as well I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic hes not that way inclined But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP it speaks volumes And then the critics every layer of it it is considered a modern day classic album Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall E Yeah I had kinda known that going in Once I kinda knew what direction I was going I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that and like I said to be able to make sense But I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones and in other words I knew that obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan and why doesnt he do Stan and all I kept thinking was Stans dead You know what Im saying he died in the story So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story but I needed to get the right beat and be able to ZL As soon as it starts as well Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept E Yeah as soon as I heard the words to the chorus I got this beat this beat was sent to me and had those words on it And sometimes for me its like I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone elses words and interpret them my own way ZL For sure when you hear that chorus Im sure initially its a st person scenario or self hatred scenario but its tied into theres layers to that Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and Im back again And then you got to deal with the story and at the end its taking everyone to the end when you couldnt be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career I mean its the ultimate type of acknowledgement isnt it Meeting your maker almost really is that the inspiration behind it E Its kinda like saying if youre going to go down this road then youre going to call it this and this is going to be the title and this is all of these things coming back on me ZL Its an amazing opening to the record and its really ambitious as well So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record When did you first have the idea of working with Rick E Ive always been a fan of Ricks and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it I had my reservations just because I felt like Im a super fan of Rick and Id probably be a little nervous and wouldnt know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre ZL Had you met Rick before E Nah Id never met him So I was like nervous to meet him and you know even more nervous to work with him ZL Same thing with Dre all the way back same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time E Yeah Im still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick what if were not able to come up with anything I had all these things in my head and then when I met him the guys so laid back it made it easy And his vibe in the studio is very much like Try whatever dont be afraid to try whatever even if the idea in the beginning is stupid Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages not mine of course mine are just insane from the moment I think of them but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest ZL Dont be afraid to fail to get somewhere else to get on the journey E So if you say one thing thats going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought thats kinda how it went We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP but I didnt want to say anything yet to him because I wasnt percent sure and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop Even from early on Beastie Boys its incredible And thats what I was kinda hoping to get How can I make the record sound nostalgic but subliminally nostalgic So it reminded you of maybe years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older but youre not sure why you feel this way Tried to create a feel so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me Like I said I was hoping to get what I got from him ZL The first time I saw Berzerk as well I was so happy to see the way that you came through and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style it was fan boy stuff for me To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad Rock thing and it was cool I love that Embed

How Come Lyrics So I changed huh You got a phone Pick up and call me How come we dont even talk no more and you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how This bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you We were so young so full of life and vibrance Side by side wherever you was riding I went So close almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit When Ronnie died you was right by my side With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it You even had the same type of childhood I did Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours And mine I survived it You ran the streets I to ed it We grew up grew apart as time went by us And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I dont like it How come we dont even talk no more and you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how This bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse On my own album with a deal but shit got worse Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first For I let him disrespect me or check me over some worrisome Bitch that I wasnt with I woulda hit it and quit But you were playing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit I told you dont get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk Like yall was husband and wife or something But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced You acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose But I am really your friend Im just trying to tell ya the truth Dont hate the game or the player the one thats changing is you How come we dont even talk no more and you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how This bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block And homies in the hood only see me on the tube So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown Shady made it so my babies aint starving at home See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies Aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise How come when you talk its with bitter and spite Its my fault for what you did with your life And every time I go to hear you play you look away We barely embrace you cant even look me in my face How come When we started dating I was almost Now Im missing that big behind And all I do is drive think about our lives Come home every night dodging butcher knives And I aint gon lie I like the attention Sleeping with other wives saying Im out fishing Lets put it all behind lets settle our difference You ready to talk Im ready to listen Back in the days I was feening for fame Its a shame rappers just like coochie you kick game until you bang And every waking morning Im doing the same thing Just hanging and brainstorming just trying to make a name When you blessing the game Thats when everyone around you whole perception will change And you accept it cuz you made it But when your funds faded your treated like a scoundrel Obviously your homies never gave a shit about you I paid my dues twice and I aint lying See thats first in the hood and the other after I signed No time for being kind when your enemies shown I walk alone while yall trying anything to get on How come we dont even talk no more and you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years weve been down Aint no way no how This bullshit cant be true We family aint a damn thing changed unless its you Embed
Baruch College Freestyle LyricsPart I Soul On Ice Ras Kass The final problem is solved by throwin sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve Droppin bodies like it was domino season My phenomenal legion will shoot out Your fuckin abdominal region Slim Shady responsible for your permanent stillness Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness Itchin to rip your fuckin frame out Cause I aint got nothing to lose Like that movie that just came out Callin your name out first last and your middle initial Your mom your dad and your pregnant widow will miss you And anybody else poppin some shitll go with you Cause I aint tryna hear it like a political issue So until I can leave with enough funds Imma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones Drown em face down in the bath while the tub runs Got a rap sheet thats longer than Tubbys sub buns Part II And Ima kill it just so yall think that I cant come off the top And Ill be forced to rock unorthodox styles from off the top of the dome with a popular poem Forget a damn team I can stop you alone Rappers thinkin they puttin out they records cause they sell But they cantt fuck with what me we doin here with A L Yall dont wanna do it when we kick it When we kick the fluid rappers dont wanna get into it Yall knew it cause the feds want me They headhunt me Im Ted Bundy I aint dead I just fled country Said bluntly a cannibal animal fed monthly Eating bread crunchy cement beds comfy Heads lumpy funky like a dead skunk be Med flunkie jump off cliffs with thread bungie Wearin red undies and a black cape Rollin through the hood cracked out bumpin your whack tape Im comin through dumpin Change your rap name to Richard Jewell Cause you aint blowing up nothing Im showin up puffin Throwin up drinkin Killin braincells til Im slow and not thinkin Growin up stinkin born with bad odor Give me Hennessy but please dont add soda Now whos doper You couldnt beat me when Im sober Im off my fuckin rocker like your grandma tippin over Slim Shady Son where you from son Yo Im from Detroit city Uh huh Im bout to do a little something like this A little something like this Ok drop that shit Bust it bust it Yo I hang with a bunch of hippies And wacky tobacco planters Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack o lanterns Outsidaz baby and we suin the courts Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source Yo they never shoulda booted me outta reform school Deformed fool taking a shit in a warm pool Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn I said it wasnt me I got a twin It all started when my mother took my bike away Cause I murdered my guinea pig And stuck him in the microwave After that it was straight to the forty ouncers Slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors Class clown freshman dressed like Les Nessman Forget the next lesson Ill pass the test guessin And all the other kids said Eminem is a thizz head Hell never last the only class hell ever pass is phys ed Maybe true til I told this girl in gym class That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast Yeah girl you so big You stepped walked into Vic Tannys And stepped on Jenny Craig She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig Put me in a headlock then I thought of my guinea pig I felt the evilness and started transformin It began stormin I heard a bunch of cheerin fans swarmin Picked that bitch by her hair drug her across the ground And threw her up to the highest Diving board to toss her down Sorry coach its too late to tell me stop While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop cause its like that And I come in and I start wildin and shit Then I be busting a lyric And rappers dont believe Im freestyling it Well here it goes when Im kicking lyrical flows From your head to your toes So that every rapper in this place knows Cause when it comes to the freestyle Coming off of the top of the dome Im knocking your mouth and ya off so who you copying off Stop being soft Im standing on top of your loft Killing you off slowly like Roberta Flack Ive never heard of wack MCs that try to step to me Ill break your verta back Or vertebrae increase the murder rates In states Yo check it Im bout to pass the mic to the next MC who wanna step up and flex With the techs but make sure your shit is fresh Come on wreck it who wanna be next It goes like this Broke the rubber busted a nut up in your mother So how do you feel about having another little brother Nasty motherfucker talking trash like a trucker Snatch your bitch up out your track Ill smack her up and fucked her Always talk shit high smoking chocolate Thai So yall can die just for walking by giving an awkward eye Ive lost my motherfucking marbles Smelling like a brewery Droolin at the way your jewelery sparkles Head full of charcoal smoked out brain particles Burning holes in clothes articles A retarded fool since I started school Burned the weed before I learned to read disregarded rules Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes Kissing front dashes from smashing up Cars like stunt crashes Hall passes for restrooms chewing mushrooms Doing rush fumes in the lunch room Looking nervous liquor in my thermos Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits Staring at the bitch with firm tits Jacking off aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits Set it off Rappers get beheaded if they soft Yo they get they wires crossed Rappers try to step to me but Im so ill Ill fire your boss And this is all freestyle killing it While Im filling it with adrenaline rappers be feeling it Like it was braille so yall can touch me anywhere Cause I want you to feel me Rappers wanna kill me but they dont thrill me So check it Im bout to wreck when I make the record Cause Im skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit Running butt naked away from just being date raped Rappers I twist em into a great shape And throw em in the Great Lakes Cause Im from the Michigan state For fishermans sake I throw em and toss em in Rappers try to step to me But this is the Holocaust and youll never win Cause Ive forever been bent forever demented Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet scented And Im demented and if I said it I meant it Killin any MC cause Im Infinite and when it Comes to the way that Im spittin lyrical infinite ammunition And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin Crushing it killing it taking your best line and hushing it Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet Taking your biggest plot and foil it Rappers cant uncoil it Ill take my shit and aluminum foil it Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up Cause Imma blow up Rappers I make em ill enough to throw up Dont show up if you come to the battle Can I speed it up Just a little bit Alright thats cool Alright Bust it bust it bust it bust it bust it This one for Quest Some people say Im strange I tell them aint shit changed Im still the same lame asshole with a different name Came late to the last show with a different dame Brain ate from the last O that I sniffed of caine You know youre spaced the fuck out like George Lucas When your puke is turning to yellowish orange mucus So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers Im not a rapper Im a demon who speaks English Freak genius too extreme for the weak and squeamish Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished Cause when I drop the science Motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence Start a fire and block the hydrants Im just a mean person you never seen worse than So when Slim gets this M bursting You getting spun backwards Like every word of obscene cursing On the B side of my first single with the clean version Stopping your short life while youre still a teen virgin Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery To try to stop the blood from your Ruptured sternum internally Ill take it back before we knew each others name Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mothers frame Ill take it further back than that Back to Lovers lane to the night you were thought of and Cock block your fathers game Ill plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled So suck my dick while I take a shit And do this crossword puzzle And when Im down with ten seconds left in the whole bout Imma no a head butt so hard I knock us both

Freestyle LyricsI stay higher than racial tension with a facial expression Tensed up like Im suffering from a case of nasal congestion Eyes hazel complexion beige age still in question Critics hate my tape kids cant wait for the next one As long as theres rejects my tape never ejects the deck Thats the level of respect each CD gets While yall graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin And gasping at air and collapsing in malls Im just a realistic impression of artistic expression Whose tape was in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen So when I launch a verse full of controverse Thatll haunt you worse than Ma e before he joined a church Im sorry kids I dismissed this class Im going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas Um Mr Mathers just missed the bathroom Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass This is my last album cause this is my last Valium Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom If yall dont like the shit that youre hearing Then blow me til your lipstick is smearing And I can see my dick disappearing May rd That means were taking over this year you heard you heard Yo May rd That means were taking over this year you heard you heard Embed
Infinite Lyrics Ah yeah This is Eminem baby back up in that motherfucking ass One time for your motherfuckin mind We represent the you know what I m saying Yo they don t know shit about this for the Ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction To get your brain relaxin the zany actin maniac in action A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run My rhymin skills got you climbin hills I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills Im slimin grills of roaches with spray that disinfects And twistin necks of rappers Til their spinal column disconnects Put this in decks and check the monologue Turn your system up twist em up And indulge in the marijuana smog This is the season for noise pollution contamination Examination of more car tunes than animation My lamination of narration Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation When I declare invasion There aint no time to be starin gazin I turn the stage into a barren wasteland Im Infinite you heard of Hell Well I was sent from it I went to it serving a sentence For murdering instruments Now Im trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat Im tempted To make another attempt at it Im Infinite Bust it I let the beat commence So I can beat the sense in your elite defense I got some meat to mince A crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse I greet the gents and ladies I spoil loyal fans I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep full of people MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one Imitator intimidator stimulator Simulator of data eliminator Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases My thesisll smash a stereo to pieces My a cappella releases classic masterpieces Through telekinesis it eases you mentally Gently sentimentally instrumentally With entity dementedly meant to be Infinite Im Infinite you heard of Hell Well I was sent from it I went to it serving a sentence For murdering instruments Now Im trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat Im tempted To make another attempt at it Im Infinite Man I got evidence Im never dense And Ive been clever ever since my residence was hesitant To do some shit that represents the MO So Im assuming all responsibility Cause theres a monster will in me That always wants to kill MCs Mic nestler slammin like a wrestler Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler No one is specialer my skill is intergalactical I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical Id rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy In fact I cant see or cant imagine A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin So this is for my family the kid who had a cameo On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit Im tensed a bit and tempted When I see the sins my friends commit Im Infinite you heard of Hell Well I was sent from it I went to it serving a sentence For murdering instruments Now Im trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat Im tempted To make another attempt at it Im Infinite And on and on and on Embed

it His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes choking how Everybodys joking now The clocks run out times up over blaow Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better Los Angeles make some noise You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose

Crackers And Cheese Lyrics Other man I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin Do you know who I am And many reply with a grin Yes Im tired of being obtruded Why should I be secluded Ive got a brand new horn to be tooted To sum it up in a nutshell Eminem will you kick it for me So I find myself in a certain obligatory A place that I dwell in fell into some wonderful productions To make up for lost time and then it brings obstruction Finally let loose unloading the stockpile A mental projectile I aim at the reptile I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus Is there a reason for this The hindrance is aggravating How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading Fading from existence cause simulations are dead Theres so much more to learn and pages left to be read So put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor Words can weigh a ton Therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one Yeah Its another Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side But I see no borderline from under this colorblind And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred Wrong the world would never endure to arguing Awaking to the absence of unity is startling Oh foolish pride what the hell are you trying to do You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless faceless Damn youre dull its time you faced this here taste this Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles The date of my birth on the Earth the deliverance of a starchild Blessed with formidable talent and versatility But with such a power there comes a responsibilty To infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear To form an alliance is something even the giants fear So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin Refusal of usin is accepted now its a trend Yeah Its another You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along You hate me but you know me and what I stand for No so then why do you speak for me And every other white man when you that were your enemy On the floor lies a broken door cause Im not to be spoken for Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore Rarely do you see the lighter side of me I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry But is isolated apologies are exhausted Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted Switch to the opposite now scenes are being re enacted Pull up that boy by his roots destroy him quick His fractures obviating we hate him his patterns past us huh Always fighting for the position of top dog That spots already occupied and I dont play leapfrog Cause I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine But Im always having to prove myself time after time Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast Judged from the past and hes put last And others with nothing to say Stutterin and slurrin and mutterin words with no meaning attack be signin like Danny Kaye Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin And eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please Ive got a craving Embed

The Way I Am Lyrics Dre just let it run Ayo turn the beat up a little bit Ayo This song is for anyone Fuck it just shut up and listen Ayo I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this on this Earth And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension Dispensing these sentences getting this stress Thats been eating me recently off of this chest And I rest again peacefully But at least have the decency in you To leave me alone when you freaks see me out In the streets when Im eating or feeding my daughter To not come and speak to me I dont know you And no I dont owe you a mothafuckin thing Im not Mr NSync Im not what your friends think Im not Mr Friendly I can be a prick if you tempt me My tank is on empty no patience is in me And if you offend me Im lifting you ten feet in the air I dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe Im tired of all you I dont mean to be mean But thats all I can be its just me And I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the paper the news every day I am Radio wont even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the paper the news every day I am I dont know thats just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense Its constant and Oh its his lyrical content The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at em but not the index or pinkie Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too When a dudes getting bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin Where were the parents at And look where its at Middle America now its a tragedy Now its so sad to see an upper class city havin this happening Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need For the fire to burn and its burning and I have returned And I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the paper the news every day I am Radio wont even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the paper the news every day I am I dont know thats just the way I am Im so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label lets stop with the fables Im not gonna be able to top on My Name Is And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation To cop me rotation at rock n roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to what hood I grew up in The why the who what when the where and the how Til Im grabbing my hair and Im tearin it out Cause they driving me crazy I cant take it Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit And Im thankful for every fan that I get But I cant take a shit In the bathroom without someone standing by it No I wont sign you an autograph You can call me an asshole Im glad And I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the papers the news every day I am Radio wont even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am In the paper the news every day I am I dont know its just the way I am Pain pain Pain pain Pain pain Ahh Cause I am whatever you say I am Cause I am whatever you say I am Cause I am whatever you say I am Radio wont even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am Cause I am whatever you say I am Embed

The Monster Explained LyricsYou have reached the voicemail box of Suck it Hey Em Whats going on Its Paul Uh I wanted to call you to let you know were getting ready to shoot the Monster video We got dates for Rihanna and shes gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot Weve got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think were ready to go So the basic concept is sort of like an Inception type of vibe The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna in the beginning is gonna act as your therapist And you answer into her office you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off were not really sure And next thing you know youre travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career And theres various stops along the way Were gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments I had to go home and get my straightjacket Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I dont remember it Dr Dre would say Im glad to see you got your coat back on The way things should be The scene from the My Name Is video with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrists office there The song which recieved an Oscar for you yes Lose yourself will also be included Were gonna go back and revisit The Way I Am with you jumping off the building falling through the sky with everything moving past you And then were also gonna do the classic Grammy scene with you and Elton John performing Stan I cant see it all Even if I could itll all be grey But your picture on my wall it reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad So all these things are going on in your head Youre travelling through the elevator looking at it from a new perspective with you watching yourself And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator you come out and you see this sort of caged beast And the beast is actually Slim Shady Slim Shadys inside of this cage and you walk up and you dont really know whats going on And then you see its actually yourself And Slim Shadys feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it And the songsll keep coming back out So its really kind of a trip Its very surreal Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and its more of a story through this journey So anyway Call me back after you listen to this Um I sent the treatment over read through it and get ready for some really long days Later Im done Its a wrap Uh I never want to perform in these clothes again Way too small Im tryna go like quadruple X next time So these clothes are a fucking wrap too Peace out And goodnight Give it up for him folks Thank you very much Embed

Ghost Stories Lyrics Uh huh Uh huh Yo alright Yo Im possessed by evil demons that torture me while Im sleeping I keep dreaming of death and Im hearing people screaming The Devils spirits trapped inside me and I want it out Im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house With both of my wrists slit Im lifted up in the air And suspended in animation like someones holding me there I feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes Tripping over ODd bodies of dead lushes Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushes Doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves Curtains catch fire the house melts My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adams apple Two cups of holy water and Im looking at em half full But as soon as I go to touch em they turn into red rum It got silent then all these voices said Come Follow me into the gates of Hell I heard em yell Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother Covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess And told me Thats just for starters Satanll be in to see me later to see if Im interested in being partnersEmbed

Green Gold Lyrics What would it take to push a man Far enough to put something material over a human life What would drive someone completely over the edge To do some shit like that for green and gold I done filled my lungs up with so much of this crack smoke My necks bloated my TECs loaded Im flat broke and Im pissed off Mad at the world Ive had it with girls and Im frustrated Ran to the bus stop just made it and hopped on Ready to drop bombs on the first person Who had a nice suit and a watch on I spot John white collar worker in clean cut Walked up to him hes like What What you mean What You know what time it is man At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch With that diamond wristband Got his green and his gold dashed and climbed in his van To steal it and seen a man holding a nine in his hand Shot him from the bottom up Stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck Hopped out to flee on my feet Fucked around and forgot that I left my ID on the seat Your arrival want survival but is you fit Your arrival want survival but is you fit Im rising with the sun Synthesized with the universal Im goin to be a better man and this be my rehearsal For the future this your game Make a name to get the fame and the dame Forget the same as everybody who came Before its simple and plain You be a mere facsimile Fallen like Gallipoli Thinking yall from Italy But Im the goumba and Im working hard at my craft Great grandpa carried concrete up a shaft What did you laugh Huh Yeah you You think its funny raising kids Without no books without no money Ma got honey funny thing its that you think youre seeing me A mere reflection in the mirror here I come Im getting nearer Coming even closer can you feel a realer presence in your being We inside lyrical ride and I advise you now youre seeing A true seer never fear cause Im here in your midst forever Cleverly helping you better see yourself that be my gist Open fisted let my energy flow we good to go Its Able bodied Mr Zinn Vesuveo Survivor Soul Watch em fold hold the gold smoke the green gimme the gravy Give it up dont give a fuck like Slim Shady Between you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will lost getcha gold heaven hold getcha green Tween you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will die sold a soul for green and gold now say goodbye Should I ever live to fulfill this dream Would I ever kill for the life of the team If I ever came between you and the green Whos the fiend By any necessary means I chase a dream thats deep like space To conquer then escape from this place without a trace But I await to face personal mercenaries Bounty hunters wanna check me for my nickel bags Ill be smoking til my eyes bleed red Meet me if you can then proceed ahead Reach for what you need now No time to think just move and react Who you gonna call when the wall is at your back Trying to blitzkrieg me for the sack Fiends better believe me sure as I breathe Their teams be getting touched back Rush me and I cut back the rumor that you only live once Lets put it to the test so we can live like legends Down to hold the line like Selassie Hold the seventh seal of heaven every time If a subtleties committed somebody fumbled the dime Winners guzzle the wine I smuggle mine with them But he who has the whole nine Will always double down and play for ten These are the rules adversaries stayin cool Shooting glances like pool While you dying for the change Im changing for the principle Mystical rebel soul in the physical Behold the gold but dont fold for the green Untold best unkept secret unseen A king should only tell his queen one thing The light sleeper is the keeper of the team But keep it between you and me Embed
Power Freestyle Lyrics Come in spittin with not writtin non fiction Rappers try to step to this with no prediction It doesnt matter cause Im smashin and bashin and crashin I hate rappers with a passion when Im chilling with DJ Fashion Yo I need a frickin kleenex so I die like River Phoenix When Im chillin with Phoneix with two Coronas Im on the microphone and Im a own this Yo and Im a bone this in Arizona Yo rappers that aint able That cant stay stable Im on two turn tables With my man but he doesnt matter cause he kicks lyrics galore And hes only five foot four Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get groovy My man got carded at a rated R movie But it really didnt matter he wasnt insulted He said Im years old yo Im an adult kid But yo still Slim Shady gets ill with the skill And Im a always bill and kill my babys mama Just to piss the world off just to piss the girls off Yo I earl off The top of the building kill women and children And then it hit me Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me Couldnt believe it yo yall cant conceive it Its Slim Shady Ill fuck a girl in her cleavage Bleep that out and you can keep it just bleep it Yo yall keep it a secret Im top secret like pop secret Rappers they dont wanna see Slim Shady Im from the motherfucking D Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha ha Yo yo Slim ShadyEmbed
Eat It Lyrics Sixteen years old and completely unstoppable Cant be dropped so Im considered undroppable Step my way and you must be insane Dont come near me if you dont like pain Suckers keep talkin and I just about had it This is my game and Im the best at it I write the rules and Im the best in my division I win by a knockout never decision Dont even try it punk just forget your wish Unless you like to eat fish and dont fuck with this Silly suckers talkin trash is one thing I cant stand You wanna talk trash go be a garbage man Cause Ill treat you like garbage throw your ass away So you better start breaking out before you get taken out My rhymes are like food because you always need it But yo you wanna bite it punk Ill make you eat it Any emcee that wanna be like me Stop wishing then come back to reality You dont have what it takes too many mistakes Im sorry to tell you but those are the breaks With the brains of a scientist and the rhymes of a poet Dont tell me that Im good because I already know it Never has there been someone with this much potential Always pack a mic because its simply essential Using the microphone as a murderous weapon Put it to my mouth and all the suckers are steppin Dont try to play me out because Im not a game Now that Im on the scene things are gonna change Dont ask me to battle if we have well youll lose it Dont pick up a mic you dont know how to use it The mic is not a toy and Im not a little boy If youre thinkin bout laughin remember Im the one employed This is not a band and were not a bunch of singers Its MC Double M and DJ Butter Fingers Now because of his name that dont mean he slips Two is called a duo and this song is called a hit Now just because Im good that dont mean Im conceited If thats impression you got Im sorry you were misleaded Whenever theres a battle naturally I win it It dont take but a minute til the sucker falls in it All it takes is once for you to step to me and Now you better pick what hospital youre gonna be in But thats not the point what the point Im tryna make is You talk behind my back and thats where your mistake is But this song is not about you aint what Im tryna say Talkin bout myself is a better subject anyway But now its time to say peace we stated the facts Double M Butter Fingers the New Jacks What Bro just fuckin talk it up jus Okay Motherfuckin bitch Here you go I I I I I Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee di da da Is the beat goin Embed

Dumpin Lyrics Ayo yo this is motherfuckin Eminem Dirty Dozen bout to show you How we set it when we come through Know what Im sayin Word up bitch motherfuckers better raise up Yall motherfuckers better raise up Ayo buss it Ayo Im a pit bull terrier triple darin ya Scarin ya with a derringer Ready to make you wet like a submariner Tearin ya frame out with homicidal lines Bringin the drama and the trauma to your mamas vital signs A verbal shot fired this mics been hot wired Uppercuts to your chin knockin your snot skyward Rappers wanna be screenplay actors So Im givin they spine fractures Like linebackers from the Green Bay Packers And roll over em backwards Dirty Dozen Im someone you just dont wanna see like a nerdy cousin So keep your distance when I get this tense You see my fist clench Its gonna be some bullets dispensed You best to keep your premises fenced You missed hints any resistance Get you voided like misprints Youll end up with no teeth left makin a beef threat When I roll up on your set Dont get it twisted like Keith Sweat When I get to bustin you best to get to jumpin Im touchin somethin Fool Im comin through dumpin My beats bumpin you hear it thumpin That oughta tell you somethin Bitch Im comin through dumpin Bullets hit you your heart stops pumpin Your blood starts clumpin Im comin through dumpin If you dont know you best make an assumption I got you slumpin Fool Im comin through dumpin A proven fact my pact got your whole team movin back We never losin slack I paid dues in rap Im runnin till my shoes are tapped My writers use them gats my thugs fuse them cracks Relax and catch a contact to an amusin track Slugs dispatched on any street riz and mismatch My teamll get busy like rednecks on some six packs My fist crack the featherweight my wordsll never break A clever snakell be forever fake Let me get this cheddar straight Makin dough is a part so is the heart my flow is the art Me and the mic Gomez like Lois Clark Weapons concealed until death now see em My chrome shatter bones that lack calcium Knockin domes out the ballpark Your dawgs is all bark plus you got a small heart Now save them corny lines for Hallmark I want the sunny days and money paid in them figures A microphone fiend And on my own team theres fake niggas Mums they rocked the cradle I spot the fable They made the shop and stable with grass top the table The Glock enable when I pop the fatal Phonies that I plot prenatal wax The player haters never make it back Im dumpin When I get to bustin you best to get to jumpin Im touchin somethin Fool Im comin through dumpin My beats bumpin you hear it thumpin That oughta tell you somethin Bitch Im comin through dumpin Bullets hit you your heart stops pumpin Your blood starts clumpin Im comin through dumpin If you dont know you best make an assumption I got you slumpin Fool Im comin through dumpin Ayo we dont say fat we stay business The third nigga on the mic representin Aint shit stoppin us old school like Cold Crush Slice and dice MCs on the mic like cold cuts Live and direct comin straight from the ghet Where niggas keep it real and make these girls panties wet I cant forget the DJ he play we say Funky type of shit that make the crowd wanna flip We dont bust clips guns is not in us But when shit get deep its a must that we bust Arm leg leg arm and head Or afros and facing bald heads all way down to the dreads s to drink endos we smoke And the rims that we ride on are true deez spokes Tires know a lot of Michaels but they dont live on Myers Bitchs pussy tight here come the dick pliers Whats my name Call me sire on the mic like titty dancers on the fire When you hear my beat live crowds jumpin I m comin through dumpin Other MCs like Doug E Fresh ain t sayin nuttin Bitch nigga Im comin through dumpin Go to the church I ll have the dick in cold humpin Word up cause my shit be comin through dumpin When Im lifted dont quiz this it aint worth it to risk it I quick with the gift and twice as swift with the biscuit Headed back to ship off All these niggas ass around Christmas They know its the time of year they be expectin my visits Doin on the henzel runnin to get it And twist you niggas like a pretzel Blows come in three like the Godfather trilogy Im Micheal Corleone with this mic Bitch you aint killin me Let me see some hands to make sure yall feelin me Im stickin you up for your rocks And yall gon give em up willingly Rap is my life and thats why every day I live it Punches holes in the floor like wack rappers records Man aint a nigga in here is bringin in drama this thick Then they time to come up shorter Than bloods on a midgits shit can you dig it Kyu comin through with somethin Guarenteed to make your whole fuckin block jumpin Comin through dumpin When we come we got your knees cumblin Yall niggas aint sayin nothin cause we comin dumpin What you talkin Nigga get to walkin See your bitch ass crew stalkin but we gon get to dumpin You dont want it

Letter To Detroit LyricsDetroit There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets You cant define it but you can feel it You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home From people who are always proud to declare Im from Detroit You took our country from its infancy into industry And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel muscle and sweat You became the city that carried the country The city like the sport is built on dreams People who would drive to you driven to excel Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork without sacrifice When you hurt we hurt Your streets witness our struggle Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered of each factory closed Weve lived through the ups and the downs But we remain Detroit We can never turn our backs on you Detroit because we are you My home The home of Motown Cadillac and Joe Louis Through all this we cannot be defeated because we have never been defeated Youve built us youve moved us youve shaped us Sometimes down but never out Take strength in us your people Stay up Detroit Embed

Public Service Announcement LyricsPublic Service Announcement and another annoying message from Slim Shady Due to a massive amount of bootlegging No thanks to this fucking guy DJ Whoo Kid And constant downloading People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work They are just continuing to get songs for free Teenagers older folks and little fucking brats alike See what they do is they buy computers strictly pick songs that they like And burn them on to CDs or put them on iPods Causing major decrease in sound scan Putting music retail in a tremendous slump Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales And be forced to tour Causing more stress Arguments with my wife Not being able to see my kids Drink more Take more pills Punch more people in the face Hate the world And end up in rehab sighs This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers Not that I wouldnt have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid But now that I rap for a living Buy my goddamn CDs But in the meantime buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid and put more money in his pocket Thanks Embed

Walk On Water Stan Love The Way You Lie LyricsWalk On Water I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Why are expectations so high Is it the bar I set My arms I stretch but I cant reach A far cry from it or its in my grasp but as Soon as I grab squeeze I lose my grip like the flyin trapeze Into the dark I plummet now the skys blackening I know the marks high butter Flies rip apart my stomach Knowin that no matter what bars I come with Youre gonna harp gripe and Thats a hard Vicodin to swallow so I scrap these As pressure increases like khakis I feel the ice cracking because I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Its the curse of the standard That the first of the Mathers discs set Always in search of the verse that I havent spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect Ive garnered The rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless And it always feels like Im hittin the mark Til I go sit in the car listen and pick it apart Like This shit is garbage Gods given me all this still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me as a god this is retarded If only they knew its a facade and its exhaustive And I try not to listen to nonsense But if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished Im not God sent Nas Rakim Pac B I G James Todd Smith And Im not Prince so I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Cause Im only human just like you Making mistakes oh if you only knew I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do Cause Im terrified to let you down oh Its true Im a Rubiks a beautiful mess At times juvenile yes I goof and I jest A flawed human I guess But Im doin my best to not ruin your ex Pectations and meet em but first The Speedom verse now Big Sean Hes goin too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom There was a time I had the world by the balls eatin out my palm Every album song I was spazzin the fuck out on And now Im gettin frowned and clowned on But the only one whos looking down on Me that matters nows DeShaun Am I lucky to be around this long Begs the question though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home Is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And its time to wash out the blonde Sales decline the curtains drawn Theyre closin the set Im still pokin my head from out behind And everyone who has doubt remind Now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times Now let em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight outta mind I might go outta mine Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin tightrope outta twine But when I do fall from these heights though Ill be fine I wont pout or cry or spiral down or whine But Ill decide if its my final bow this time around cause I walk on water But I aint no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Cause Im only human just like you Ive been making my mistakes oh if you only knew I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do Cause Im terrified to let you down oh If I walked on water I would drown Cause Im just a man But as long as I got a mic Im godlike So me and you are not alike Bitch I wrote Stan Stan My teas gone cold Im wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I cant see at all And even if I could itd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint callin I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom I sent two letters back in autumn you must notve got em There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em But anyways fuck it whats been up man Hows your daughter My girlfriends pregnant too Im bout to be a father If I have a daughter guess what Ima call her Ima name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didnt want him I know you probably hear this every day but Im your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man I like the shit you did with Rawkus too that shit was phat Anyways I hope you get this man hit me back Just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is Stan My teas gone cold Im wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I cant see at all And even if I could itd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad Love the Way You Lie Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I cant tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight High off her love drunk from her hate Its like Im huffin paint And I love her the more I suffer I suffocate And right before Im about to drown she resuscitates me She fuckin hates me and I love it Wait Where you going Im leaving you No you aint Come back Were runnin right back here we go again Its so insane cause when its goin good its goin great Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed I snap Whos that dude I dont even know his name I laid hands on her Ill never stoop so low again I guess I dont know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lieEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics Look if you had one shot or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already Moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes choking how Everybodys joking now The clocks run out times up over blaow Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo This whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring but superstardoms Close to post mortem it only grows harder Homie grows hotter he blows its all over These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada and so the soap opera Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner But the beat goes on da da dom da dom dah dah dah dah You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better No more games Ima change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I cant get by with my nine to Five and I cant provide the right type of life for my family Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life And these times are so hard and its gettin even harder Tryna feed and water my seed plus teeter totter Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot another day of monotonys Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not Mom I love you but this trailers got To go I cannot grow old in Salems Lot So here I go its my shot feet fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better You can do anything you set your mind to manEmbed

Blown Away Lyrics A M I was dead asleep Heard two people screaming outside in the street It was a guy and his girl they were having a fight Still half asleep middle of the night Screaming and cussing thats all you could hear See the girls face and its filled with fear The screaming gets louder this has gotta be solved But Im saying to myself not to get involved But its gotta be done someone might get hurt So I grabbed a pair of pants and I throw on a shirt Heard a shot outside put my Nikes on Seen the girl lying half dead on the lawn I was scared but in a hell of a rage Went back in the house loaded up my gauge Come back outside girls still on the ground I paused for a second and I turned around Looked up in the dark and I saw a man Six feet from me with a gun in his hand He shot first but the sucker missed I was no longer scared by this time I was pissed The girl was shot in the head and I thought she was dead The whole spot was red from the blood that was shed Im still on the ground the sucker points his gun I thought I was dead no chance to run The girl reaches out from behind the man Springs herself forward knocks the gun from his hand I grab my gauge and ran halfway down the block Ducked into the alley it was one oclock He picks his gun back up to continue the chase Turns around and shoots the girl straight dead in the face I jumped into a dumpster and I closed the lid Aint no motherfucker gonna shoot this kid He kept on runnin and he passed me up I come up from behind him and I said Whats up The punk turned around and his eyes got bigger I squeezed the gun tight and I pulled the trigger Shot him right in the chest blew him back ten feet And the sucker laid dead middle of the street In the streets of Detroit this happens every day But fuck with this kid and get blown away Embed

you have to stay away from truth Yes you can have have a backpack This is serious this is serious I dont care if you have a backpack in your first verse You got three verses and you try to have a knapsack in the third verse No You cannot have a backpack and a knapsack You pick one or the other Pick a fucking fanny pack I dont care But you cannot have a backpack and knapsack And if theres gonna be violence it cannot rhyme with silence In advance were telling you that You cannot have a riot and be quiet You cant wait be on the block with the Glock And make it cock No block Glock cock No more

Renegade LyricsIts Young Money Euro look I hear the shots bein fired My enemies wired Keep pushin me to execute the same folks I inspired like why Tire yourself out to be hopeless and tied Anyone over me is simply roastin over the fire Im over desired flow Fijis spit feces its my time Dont gotta watch to see me believe me cant take it easy Til my house in Providence looks like the one in Washington DC No need to campaign expect change Imma do my damn thing think otherwise you damn wrong Trynna balls out when motherfuckers tell you to keep your pants on I hear the softest rappers throwing temper tantrums And these hardcore rappers singing camp songs Something aint right aint nothing alike we nothing alike I keep my distance they squinting to see something in sight Take a step closer for some to say I hope you know that no weapon will ever be stronger than what I spit on the mic I understand I might be out of my line Getting on a beat thats out of my time Im out of my mind But fuck it Im over average I no longer feel a challenge When people would rather listen to whos trending than who has talent Blame the environment its never silent Couldnt dream every attempt to sleep disturbed by sirens Such a violent harmony plays when you strum my vocal cords on a violin I am in no position of quitting on living the life I was given Driven and became distant from those who witnessed I kept working they kept wishing thats the difference Threatened by my spitting so they spit on my image Im a spitting image of linen wait a minute Didnt you say I couldnt and wouldnt do But I did it couldnt fit in so I told em good riddance Yall forgotten not forgiven I wouldnt have hurt your feelings if yall wasnt that similar to women I go nowhere unless its too far Im not good enough until Im better than you are whoever you are Thats if you are the real ya Its easy to die if life is hard enough to kill ya First time for everything Im everythings first time First and last word in every verse mine But first off know my first words were said in Spanish So how I manage to be this good with words and English is my second language Im a renegade Never been afraid to say whats on my mind at any given time of day Cause Im a renegade Never been afraid to holler about anything Anything anything anythingEmbed
Food Stamp Lyrics Yo yo yo My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the newsstand Two dudes ran up jumped out of a blue van I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch I swung it at the first dude the other one with him Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him So he tried to rush I swept his legs pinned him and bit him He came back with six or seven dudes screaming Get him I grabbed one lit him on fire pinned and bit him The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didnt fit him One by one I just kept droppin em in a rhythm Then I woke up swingin in the middle of the kitchen Embed

Careful What You Wish For Lyrics So this is it this is what I wished for Just isnt how I envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment I just thought the shitd be different But somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it I started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it And it became my cocaine I just couldnt quit I just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster I became a hypocrite concert after concert I was rakin in the dough rollin in green Had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine But I was losing my freedom ther was nowhere for me To not go and b seen and just go and be me And there was no in between you either loved it or hate it Every CD critics gave it a three then three Years later they go back and re rate it Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest The Marshall Mathers was a classic The Eminem Show was fantastic But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it I guess enough time just aint passed yet A couple more years that shitll be Illmatic And eight years later Im still at it Divorced re married a felon a father sleeping pill addict And this is real talk I feel like The Incredible Hulk My back has been broke and I can still walk So be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it Cause it might just come back on you ten fold I said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it Cause it might just come back on you ten fold I got a letter from a fan that said hes been praying for me Every day and for some reason Its been weighing on my mind heavy Cause I dont read every letter I get But something told me to go ahead and open it But why would someone pray for you When they dont know you You didnt pray for me when I was local And as I lay these vocals I think of all the shit I had to go through Just to get to where Im at Ive already told you At least a thousand times in these rhymes I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got God on my side And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it Just watching it from a opposite standpoint Man boys got to look Nuts and thats the only word I can think of Right now on how to describe the shit This is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit So be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it Cause it might just come back on you ten fold I said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it Cause it might just come back on you ten fold Embed

Zane Lowe BBC Radio Interview Part Lyrics Who can say for sure Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use Society will reap a great benefit Lets talk about your work on the record as a producer because I know on Relapse you did nothing on Recovery you got back into it Ive always said to you as long as Ive know you or youve been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music your production for others as well as just for yourself Oh thank you And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill So I mean how was that getting back into the producers chair and deciding to wear two hats again Urm I mean that was fun it was fun to to be able to just mess around with beats from scratch again and you know sometimes like I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super open to urr working with a lot of other producers you know that was the most I had ever done and you know aside from working with Dre You know so on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit so thats kinda how early on we started approaching this record or this album and sometimes like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and Im not always gonna get that by going through you know different tracks if other people have made they dont know whats in my head you know what Im saying so its also a good way to ur I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too with the sound and all that you know I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch It just sounds like your being inspired by rap in a big big way I mean Absolutely I mean I know youve always been that way weve known each other for a long time and Ive met you at various points throughout every album and I know that its I just met you out there I thought Its all good man Im still peeling the floors Um you know and the music reflects your head space its always been pretty honest not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of kind of a lot of Drama The beats on here are fun I mean theyre fat big and rap Like inspired by hip hop Yeah I mean its pretty much all I do and all I wanna do you know what Im saying like so its fun for me like Im still you know like Im still passionate about hip hop and every aspect of it so making beats and producing you know is definitely its fun for me What is it about rap that you love I mean Im a huge I mean I grew up on hip hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing Ive ever done in my life pretty much to some form and what I wondered you know being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time what is it about rap the art form if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap heavy records You know just a lot of rap A lot of rapping on there a lot of words Yeah What is it about it that you love if you can put it into words Hmm I dunno I urm I love the fact that you can I love the expression of it The fact that you can you know just I dont know I love the I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and it can be therapeutic and youve got it off your chest and then you could go on to the next thing I dont know theres so much shit that I love about rap you know Im in it for like I love to watch whats going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that you know and its exciting to watch as a fan for me too you know just being a fan of hip hop urm and watching as it you know the evolution of it and you know how it moves from each year to year you know what Im saying the direction and Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now you can be a contender for the worlds greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent I hope you take this the right way because I know your strong career very popular number in countries huge but the pop stars kind of did you know in the sense of what people expect from you these days isnt it you dont have to be that guy any more you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want Is that a relief Well yeah I think so urm its one of them things like as far as like being a pop star or whatever like I never never intended to be any of that you know wha Im saying like all I ever wanted to do was get respect from you know my peers and other rappers and urm all the other stuff that came with it was just you know confusing to me it was I dont know like I dont feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever is that for me Yeah if you want it Thanks man appreciate it Urm And then boom you did And it didnt stop for years Well boom it happened but at the same time like I never wanted to when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that I mean I dont think Im stupid Im not stupid Like I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like well maybe this could possibly be a radio record or when Im going fuck shit ass you know what Im saying and I know this will never go to radio But at the same time if a song starts heading that way cause a lot of times I may even think I may even think certain things when Im writing it like maybe what person this might connect with you know what Im saying like and who I might connect with with this song But I never in making any song I have made I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity yeah you know and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy that I was at least doing my job as an MC and you know what Im saying Oh thats the struggle And doing what I feel like I need to do Thats tough man because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music youre not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful but at the same time like you say its never been on the agenda and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time huh like how do I do both How do I be good and not court this not be this guy that everybody expects something from Yeah urm I know that early on I went through a lot of that with the Hi my name is record and it was urm like I never understood like I understood that the record was funny and i understood that it was a little urm how you say kitschy or whatever and maybe the hook was the whole record was tongue in cheek You know what Im saying like Im still doing a lot of records like that to this day with the tongue in cheek but that record in particular was just like it was my it was almost like my anti pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my fuck you to the world at the same time So I never understood like when all that started happening like holy shit how did that become a you know I guess pop song So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say fuck you the more people are gonna say you know hi we love you Urm I dont know I mean Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right cause thats when it really started to to blow up again Yeah I think I think there was a lot of that and I think that just coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think you know I think that had a lot to do with it and then you know watching NWA and other people Pac you know what Im saying like it was like hes not going to him or they arent going to kiss your ass to make you like their music Yeah thats exactly what they want to do let things slide a bit you know Now you kind of talk about that on this song here on The Monster and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like its the gift and the curse you know Im aware of the trouble it can get you in Ive been through that you know Number album number movie number this number that not really in a position to really kind of really be able to absorb that yet its intoxicating isnt it Yeah it was like it was this thing where and Im not gonna lie I still wish it today that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music but then I wanna be able to go in public and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich you know what I mean and be left alone So it was like man if I could because Id never been an attention seeker and it seems like a hell of a career choice you know but I dont like attention thats not just why I do it just to get attention I dont like to be in public and walk around and be like here I am you know what I mean like its not what I want I just wanted my dream was my dream was for like fuck man to be able to one day like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio like yo what if Jay Z whoever what if they heard of me what if they thought I was dope You know what Im saying like That was where my mentality always was was with it So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around you know a lot of it still is but especially back then Yeah You know you have done something which very few people have done now youve actually been at the center of the world the center of that storm and youve emerged out of it you popped out of the other side of it I mean Elvis didnt do that you know Michael Jackson didnt do that Whitney Houston a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent unfortunately the list of various reasons Im sure personal to them is too long who didnt make it through You have and what does the world look like to you when youve come out the other side of that and youre years sober and youre looking on that chaos for some perspective Urm I dont know I mean Im definitely thankful you know what I mean I know that could have certainly took another path And gone that way yeah Yeah I could have went another direction but I dont know I mean I think that I feel like like Im probably able to see it Im able to be more focused now than Ive ever been urm but Im also able to I guess put it in perspective The problem is I cant put a lot of perspective because I dont theres a lot thats you know gone theres a lot that I dont remember and maybe thats cool too you know what Im saying where Probably a good thing Yeah but I dont know man I know I know that theres so many addicts in this world you know and people who have problems like that that dont make it you know what Im saying so I Im thankful for that but urr you know I think thats one thing that really helps me urr through and just keeps me pushing forward is the music is the passion for that

No Love Lyrics Yeah I I Im in a different space in my life you know Its a real good space too Ayo Eminem I like this song man By the time yall hear this Weezy probably be home Welcome home Weezy Reek Da Villain what up Ayo Let me tell yall niggas about one of the little tough guy dreams I just had the other night Look First I stop it then I drop it then I cock another heater Pop another leader from another cliqu that thought he was a creature That could n ver never ever ever Ever get his shit popped off When a nigga come and when a nigga front Gotta give it to em good give a nigga what he want And if a nigga act up shoot em in the hand In the face in the stomach in the foot or the heart You dont want it homie you dont wanna start Especially when a motherfucker see the gun fire spark When I got the gun up in your mouth I make a nigga gun talk Bus Rhymes Reek Imma hit em in the front homie hit em in the back Keep on hittin that nigga in the chest cavity Till that motherfucker lay down flat Trust me Imma make a nigga sit still Anytime I gotta defend the food nigga It dont matter what it is homie I will Beat a nigga till your brother cant figure it out Or i dentify the motherfucker on the real Word on everything a nigga really love It dont matter who it is homie I kill But now Im finally waking up outta the dream And I realize that life is so beautiful And I aint gotta put my hand on a nigga Unless its definitely necessary otherwise its unsuitable Going through a lot of different little things That make a nigga wanna go and wanna get in when I bring A couple goons that can handle couple situations And I let em eliminate all the bullshit so I can Run though every city run though every state Though we get a lot of love I love to get a lot of hate Though the ones who will try to hate will start to love Cause its undeniable that everything I do is great Even when I do it wrong Imma share it in a song And I question is it worth it in the end all along I guess I gotta die first return reincarnated Just to really witness it in another form But until that time Ill embellish it and shine While I set in wit the grind give me credit when its mine Boy I dead it like a nine millimeter see the sign and the heater That Im givin all my people get in line now Yeah for the ones that hate Or try to stop my growth in the light from above When I fight I hold a grudge its a Kanye shrug See the way I make em bug motherfucker dont no Its a little too late to say that youre sorry now You kicked me when I was down But what you say just dont Hurt me Thats right it dont Hurt me And I dont need you No more Dont wanna see you No more Ha bitch you get no Love You showed me nothing but hate You ran me into the ground But what comes around goes around And I dont need you Dont hurt me Thats right you dont Hurt me And I dont need you No more Dont wanna see you Ha bitch you get No love No No love No No love No No love Ha bitch you get No love No No love No No love And I dont need you No more Get em Im alive again more alive than I have been In my whole entire life I can See these peoples ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen Uh Im a little bit sicker than most Shits finna get thick again they say the competition is stiff But I get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in I aint never giving in again Caution to the wind complete freedom Look at these rappers how I treat em So why the fuck would I join em when I beat em They call me a freak cause I like to Spit on these pussies fore I eat em Man get these wack cocksuckers off stage Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him Snatch the mic from em bitch Ima let you finish in a minute Yeah that rap was tight but Im Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit And start over from scratch and write new ones But Im afraid that it aint gonna make no difference When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight Its an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump From the place all the way to the parking lot fellow Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd You can see the sparks from hot metal Cold hearted from the day I Bogarted The game my soul started to rot fellow When Im not even in my harshest You can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow Til Im topplin from the top Im not gonna stop Im standin on my Monopoly board That means Im on top of my game And it dont stop til my hip dont hop anymore When youre so good that you cant say it Cause it aint even cool for you to sound cocky anymore People just get sick cause you spit These fools cant drool or dribble a drop anymore And you can never break my stride Youll never slow the momentum at any moment Im bout to blow youll never take my pride Killin the flow slow venom And the opponent is gettin no mercy mark my words Aint lettin up relentless I smell blood I dont give a fuck keep givin them hell Where was you when I fell and needed help up You get no love Its a little too late to say that youre sorry now You kicked me when I was down But what you say just dont Hurt me Thats right it dont Hurt me And I dont need you No more Dont wanna see you No more Ha bitch you get no Love You showed me nothing but hate You ran me into the ground But what comes around goes around And I dont need you Dont hurt me Thats right you dont Hurt me And I dont need you No more Dont wanna see you Ha bitch you get No love No No love No No love No No love Ha bitch you get No love Embed

Berzerk Explained LyricsMusic I had met Paul Ems manager a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road We just worked out it was meant to be at this time I think its unlike any current hip hop songs If you listen to whats going on in hip hop this is not what this is Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record The song sort of evolves It started one way it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song And I felt the track was really strong and didnt really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally And then when I heard the vocals that was pretty exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it Its so well done and so smart and so funny Its just great In this song we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think its really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done But in the shooting stages the pieces Ive seen look really entertaining Embed

The Watcher LyricsThings just aint the same for gangstas Times is changing young niggas is aging Becoming OGs in the game and changing To make way for these new names and faces But the strangest things can happen from rapping When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic Zipped up in bags when it happens thats it Ive seen em come Ive watched em go Watched em rise witnessed it and watched em blow Watched em all blossom and watched em grow Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough Best friends and money I lost them both Went visited niggas in the hospital Its all the same shit all across the globe I just sit back and watch the show Everywhere that I go Aint the same as befo People I used to know Just dont know me no mo But everywhere that I go I got people I know Who got people they know So I suggest you lay low Im still on top of the game Still dropping flames still cock and aim Still at the top had to rock for the fame Over setbacks theres been a lot since I came You seen it all how I got how I gained The momentum when it dropped how I got through the pain When I roll and shock they watched me reclaim The streets they made a special spot for my name Dre haters wanna stop to my reign But the music lives in me every drop in my veins The pride and the pain All the way back from the rise of my name See the world clear through the eyes of the mane See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave When the beat bangs itll drive them insane The eyes that I played the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher Everywhere that I go Aint the same as befo People I used to know Just dont know me no mo But everywhere that I go And uh I started out dumb sprung off a hood rats Listenin to the radio wishin that I could rap But nothing changed I was stuck in the game Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin me mayne Listen I got a scheme break away do my own thang Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring Niggas aint wanna see me rise watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size And if I catch another case Lord knows how they hate me Got a player in the court room please dont let em frame me Ive been dealt a lot of bad cards livin as a thug Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love Maybe they seen me rollin look at all this green Im holdin I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen Hopin the heavenly father love a hustler Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut My homies tell me Have a heart fuck they feelings Ive been tryin to make a million since we started we cold hearted Niggas in masks thatll blast at the task force Empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it Me Makaveli Im a motherfucker We break bread now we thug brothers haha Niggas talk a lot of non shit I choose to ignore it A war They aint ready for it haha I know you got your eyes on me I feel you watching me But it aint hard to see that you cant see me You try but what you think you saw Aint what you thought you saw You better off not looking at all Everywhere that I go aint the same as before People I used to know just dont know me no more But everywhere that I go I got people I know Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low Im still on top of the game Still dropping flames still cock and aim Still at the top had to rock for the fame Over setbacks theres been a lot since I came You seen it all how I got how I gained The momentum when it dropped how I got through the pain When I roll and shock they watched me reclaim The streets they made a special spot for my name Dre haters wanna stop to my reign But the music lives in me every drop in my veins The pride and the pain All the way back from the rise of my name See the world clear through the

Lose Yourself Smile LyricsYo Look if you had one shot or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already Moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes choking how Everybodys joking now The clocks run out times up over blaow You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You make me smile like the sun Fall outta bed Sing like a bird Dizzy in my head Spin like a record Crazy on a Sunday night You make me dance like a fool Forget how to breathe Shine like gold Buzz like a bee Just the thought of you can drive me wild Oh you make me smileEmbed
Artificial Flavor Lyrics Who started the mimic Wack The gimmick wack Jimmy cracked corn wraps give em smacks Perhaps the copycat had no better turns When it came to racial slurs he lost his sense of balance The lame brain put more into the game With this other side of fame And I ll drop something proper By slammin the hammer down like Judge Wapner And after this face me Throwin the blows heavy so if you re Chevy don t chase me Where s your motivation taking up your spare time Tell everyone Air time don t you think you know the station So why take it upon myself to Grab your boots to amplify your parachute To rock bottom let the real rappers step off you Slide to stay inside here comes the main course Hurrah hurrah ha haha ha Good God here s the top of the blah blah blah Hey Im bout to go with the tag Its automatic its some of that stuff that makes you stop and drop and tort Cause you haven t heard it bop before It s probably because I have a different kind of outlook That creates a totally different type of output So stay put your crook and state the book Are we going become And so many rappers are giving credit when they sound pathetic But there ll be none of that repetition here uncle thus makes the business clear At the dinner did you wanna order a You better seek a savior Alert to run fast yeah Basement Productions is definitely in the house Now my fellow figures Let s go to the question Where oh where has our hip hop gone I pass the time we got a yellow ish brown lawn We got to work together to end the trouble To send the rain down and bring the sun back out Im not a happy camper Cause someone has put a damper On my spirit tamper Now I m hampered with interference We fell asleep and let the drawbridge unguarded Now we re being bombarded by garbage So I seriously think your ego boost really needs a good boost Cause you got me so bored I feel like a piece of wood So I ma break it to you gently It doesn t make you a rapper cause Oh no This kind of stuff takes practice You can t lift weights for the first time in your life and expect to be Atlas So I really recommend you find yourself a new outlet Cause you re wearing out your welcome like an outfit So the real ones I keep a close relationship I no longer have to be in association with The rappers that have been rappin offbeat and rhyming like a princible Cause this is the type of stuff that s been bumpin us off the schedule Spoke up like a tempo Blocks in front of the door to prevent the flacks Waiting for his bar to end make affiliates No more charging the door we charge the margin for No tellin em makin my eardrums numb While they re making a career from Judy has a big booty Stutterin like Porky Pig Rapping the tunes booty You can t blame it on one man and say he did it Cause the pop was flat before you put the ice in it And now it s time to break out the mustard gas and throw it up in your face until you shut your cussword ass So stop getting dumb and play smart Grow a hundred legs like a centipede And make tracks like K Mart turn you into the art Before you go take a piece of my heartEmbed

Rap Gods and Pilots Lyrics Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But Im only going to get this one chance Somethings wrong I can feel it Six minutes Six Minutes Six minutes Slim Shady youre on Just a feeling Ive got Like something is about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered I wake up fine and dandy But then by the time I find it handy To rip my heart apart and start Planning my crash landing I go up up up up up to the ceiling Then I feel my soul start leaving Like an old mans hair receding Im pleading Please oh please On my knees repeatedly asking Why its got to be like this Is this living free I dont wanna be the one Be the one to have the suns blood on my hands Ill tell the moon Take this weapon forged in darkness Some see a pen I see harpoon This flippity dippity hippity hip hop You dont really wanna get into a pissin match With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad Its actually disastrously bad for the wack While Im masterfully constructing this master piece Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard There s an infestation in my mind s imagination I hope that they choke on smoke cause I m smoking them out the basement This is not rap this is not hip hop Just another attempt to make the voices stop Rapping to prove nothing just writing to say something Cause I wasn t the only one who wasn t rushing to saying nothing This doesn t mean I lost my dream It s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean Nah I didn t understand a thing you said If I didn t know better Id guess you re all already dead Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch Saying stuff like you only live once Youve got one time to figure it out One time to twist and one time to shout One time to think and I say we start now Sing it with me if you know what I m talking about Hall of Fame Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin Little gay looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy Youre witnessing a massacre Like youre watching a church gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label every day looking boy Hey looking boy What you say looking boy I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy Ima work for everything I have never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard On the eve of a day thats forgotten and fake As the trees they await and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we dont need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes cause were told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling Theres something we need Im not free I asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied I three time MVPd this crime Im afraid to tell you who I adore Wont tell you who Im singing towards Metaphorically Im a whore and thats denial number four Once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin To censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP when I Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK a revolver and a Id die for you thats easy to say We have a list of people that we would take A bullet for them a bullet for you A bullet for everybody in this room But I dont seem to see many bullets coming through See many bullets coming through Metaphorically Im the man But literally I dont know what Id do Id live for you and thats hard to do Even harder to say when you know its not true Even harder to write when you know that tonight There were people back home who tried talking to you But then you ignore them still All these questions they re for real Like who would you live for Who would you die for And would you ever kill Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop because I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it Im evil to the core What I shouldnt do I will They say Im emotional What I want to save Ill kill Is that who I truly am I truly dont have a chance Tomorrow Ill keep a beat And repeat yesterdays dance Yo this song will never be on the radio Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote Its the few the proud and the emotional Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral The world around us is burning but were so cold Its the few the proud and the emotional Weve turned our hands to guns Traded our thumbs for ammunition I must forewarn you of my disorder or my condition Cause when the sun sets It upsets whats left of my invested interest Interested in putting my fingers to my head The solution is I see a whole room of these mutant kids Fused at the wrist I simply tell them they should shoot at this Simply suggest my chest and this confused music its Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a god Embed

One Handed Juggler Lyrics Im the man I stand in flapped by the wind as I begin Do you know who I am And met a reply with a grin Yes Im tired of being untooted Why should I be secluded Ive got a brand new horn to be tooted To sum it up in a nutshell M M will you kick it for me So I find myself in a certain obligatory A place where I dwell in pull onto some wonderful productions To make up for lost time anything is obstruction Finally let loose unloading the stockpile A mental projectile I aim like the Reptile I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this Why do you insist on stepping to an octopus Is there a reason for this The hatred is aggravating How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading Fading from existence because simulations are dead Theres so much more to learn and pages left to be read So put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor Words can weigh a ton therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one Yeah yeah Its another Very few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side But I see no borderline from under this colorblind Now some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred War the world will never enter the arguing Awakening to the absence of unity is startling Oh foolish pride what the hell is you trying to do You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to The echo we want dont mean nothing by despicable So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and youre dull Its time you faced this here taste this Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles The date of my birth on the earth the deliverance of a star child Rest with formidable talent and versatility But such a power there comes a responsibility To infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear To form an alliance thats something even the giants fear So instead of being oblivious to a color of skin Rufuser abusing is accepted now its a trend Yeah yeah Its another You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along You hate me but you know me and what I stand for No So why do you speak for me and every other white man when you say that were your enemy On the floor lies a broken door because Im not to be spoken for Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore Rarely do you see the lighter side of me I try to be persuasive but oh so impatient Been trying to end the rivalry But Ive heard the entice delayed it apologies are exhausted Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted Switch to the opposite now scenes are being reenacted Pull up set fort by his group his tour is quick Hes practiced obviating we hate him as bad as a pastor huh Always fighting for the position of top dog The spots already occupied and I dont play leap frog Because I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine But Im always having to prove myself time after time Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast Judged from the past and hes put last But nothing but nothing to say stuttering and slurring And muttering words with no meaning attack me sounding like Danny K Here I go again hammering stammering grammaring Eating it like cheese pass me the crackers please Ive got a craving Im the man Embed

Verse Lyrics Its like this and like that and like this Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless Patrolling corners looking for hookers To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters Im meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse And aint shit changed but kept the same mindstate Since the third time that I failed ninth grade You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death As I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again Shit why not Blow your brain out Im blowing mine out Fuck it you only live once you might as well die nowEmbed

Thoughts of Suicide Lyrics a lighter clicks a gun cocks then a sample plays in reverse Lies in the game how I entertain The last lines of the next Kurt Cobain Standin in the mirror with a at my brain Most rap guys wanna die for the fame Supposed to die young cause Im in the gang And I cant change cause I entertain Can sniff three verses through lines of caine You just realized that Im insane Im enraged engaged in a war with ways They can have me spray shots off the stage If I die like Malcolm will you feel my pain Or just cry like a bitch while I lay in my grave If I die like Pac cause I yearn to bang You discredit me like I never learned a thang If I die like Big would you praise my rhymes And give me the spot Best of All Time If I die in N Y will the West Coast ride And the beef not stop til hip hop die Will a nigga who dont understand that line Try and damage my safety in N Y Will the rap game embrace me cause I got skill Or for the lies of that man will I get killed nigga Im just gettin high gettin high Think of suicide suicide Im just gettin high gettin high Think of suicide suicide Im just gettin high gettin high I think of suicide suicide Will the crimes of my youth come back to haunt me By the time I shoot will my father want me When I tour will my girl be come a whore And I come back home and cant fuck her raw If I walked on stage like FUCK the law Will the hip hop cops try and kill my squad Will the niggas on my team really ride like they say Or push me in the shots he gon die anyway Is niggas really jealous cause I got shine Is it envy from the fellas cause I got signed Will the whole hood hate cause I speak my mind Will I die for a rhyme before I reach my prime If I kill my bitch like Robert Blake Do I got enough money to beat the case If I crash out right before I end the race And die fore I come out would you feel my pain Im almost to a point where I cant be saved My mindstate at a place where it cant be changed Laws got a nigga stuck like he cant get break But I gotta back up all the shit I say Its lies in the game how I entertain The last lines of the next Kurt Cobain Standin in the mirror with a at my brain Most rap guys wanna die for the fame Im just gettin high gettin high Think of suicide suicide Im just gettin high gettin high Think of suicide suicide Im just gettin high gettin high I think of suicide suicideEmbed

The Kids Lyrics Hey there little boys and girls Hey there little boys and girls Today were gonna to learn how to poison squirrels But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob Say hi Bob Bobs and still lives with his mom And he dont got a job Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot But his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock When its late and the lot gets dark And fake like he walks his dog drag em in the woods And go straight to the chopping blocks And even if they escaped and they got the cops The ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge Til one night Mrs Stacey went off the job When she felt someone grab her whole face And said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said Knock it off But Bob wouldnt knock it off Cause hes crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a doctor He grabbed Stace by the legs as chopped it off her And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander They never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana And what it might do to you So see if the squirrels want any its bad for you The kids the kids Dont forget about the kids the kids Shady what about the kids the kids The kids the kids Shady what about the kids the kids You gotta save the kids My penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it Fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut Speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels Ecstasy its the worst drug in the world If someone ever offers it to you dont do it Kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid And spinal fluid is final you wont get it back So dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back Meet Zach twenty one years old After hangin out with some friends At a frat party he gets bold And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it Suddenly he starts to convulse And his pulse goes into hyperdrive And his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb His back starts to look like the McDonalds Arches Hes on Donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin BLEH And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him H hey Adam Zach is a jackass look at him Cause they took it too so they think its funny So theyre laughing at basically nothing Except maybe wasting the money Meanwhile Zachs in a coma the action is over And his back and his shoulders Hunched up like hes practicin yoga And thats the story of Zach the ecstasy maniac So dont even feed that to squirrels class Cause its bad for you The kids the kids Shady what about the kids Dont forget about the kids the kids And last but not least one of the most humungous Problems among young people today is fungus It grows from cow manure They pick it out wipe it off bag it up And you put it put it put it put it put it Embed

and end soon And see that Im a good sucka MC No ones better than me at foolin The crowd that Im rulin Cause you know that Im co schooling Yo Mike man check this out dawg I got M M over here destined to ascend some dumb fuckin stupid backstabbing two timing Sike they know that but you know they they aint here yet so why dont we fuck around and give something to laugh at when they get here if they

the super beat finder As I look in my room the doom surrounds me in gloom And Im soon to see a big balloon flying over like the movie IT Im wondering What the fuck is this shit I dont know but this shit looks scary It aint the fuckin goddamn tooth fairy Its something fucking ugly yo this shit is nasty G So what I did is go up in my room and sit down And I wrote down a line with a sound that sounded sorta like this Then the tooth fairy bitch came again riding on a broom I said Damn you got a big warty nose you fucking baboon What the fuck are you doing here She said Im close spreading that fear cuz you know I can Im on a broom and I aint a man But I rock the plan The plan to take over the whole fuckin world And burn all the little boys and girls and children Yo Im fulfillin your deepest nightmare cuz Im willin to grab the mic and rock like a fuckin witch bitch So here I go Yo this is the witch and your doom is soon to find Yourself lying in your fuckin room With a big knife between your two fuckin eyes Because you know that its time for you to eat french fries Unless youre gonna die With the bat wings attached to your fat things That you have between your nuts So lick it up honey cuz you know thats my butt I was sittin in my house cold writin some beats When I got hit in the head with a big pair of cleats I turned around and said What the fuck is goin on Next thing I knew the shit threw me on my front lawn I jumped up and I was laying in the snow Then I looked up and it came crashing out my window I couldnt figure out what the hell it was But it was flying so high it gave me a buzz I said Damn and then they came swinging down From a big tree and it had a mean frown It had a mean grin on its chin and I began To ran down the street because I was in fear Of this thing that was comin after me And all I could hear was a goddamn catastrophe The sound of it just made me cry I said Oh my god wheres my mom I think Im gonna die I said Shit then I continued running Down the block I turned around and the shit was still comin Then I tripped and fell in a pile of dog shit I say Goddamn I think Ive just been hit by something But I still couldnt figure out what the hell it was Then it turned around and grabbed my nuts I said What the fuck is going on Then it threw me out again and I ended up on my front lawn I turned around and heard the sound of nothing Cause nothing was there I said Shit it must be bluffing I didnt see anything but I felt a smack It hit me in my head and I landed on my back But I still didnt see anything I was looking around and there still was nothing I said Damn I gotta get in my house And then I asked Charlie Charlies my mouse I said Charlie what the hell should I do He said Grab a wig and put it on and then take a poo In your house go take a shit in your toilet Thats the only thing that will foil it Its plan to overrule the kingdom I said I gotta bring some Big turds when I land them in the toilet So James take the mic And talk about what happened that mysterious night A mysterious night I was walking down the street With a broom in my hand ready to beat A sucka MC who gon step up to me Lookin real funny thinkin that hes ugly Youre goddamn fuckin right You fuckin ugly ass bastard tryna rock all night With those rhymes that sound old as shit particles You know that was the old article From an old newspaper An old sucker in But this is the new one and Im gonna have some fun But wait here comes a bitch yellin rape Shes staring at me Oh fuck shit Im outta luck I got hit by a brick from a man whos running down the street I said Fuck this shit Im getting outta here Before I lose my fucking brick That I just got stuck in my head Its hanging out and Im almost dead But I got a piece of skull laying on the ground So I pick up the shit and looked at my bones and frowned I said Damn Who the fuck would do this to another human being Must not be a man but a machine And I turned around it was a fucking computer Staring me in the head and I had to take a What the fuck am I saying I didnt know cuz half my brain was laying On the sidewalk I looked and sighed sharp I picked up a big piece of chalk and fucked it Because I dont have no more brain left The shit Im saying is brain dead cuz you know that I have half a brain and I just might cry But I aint got no more tears for this shit I pulled the brick out my head and then I flicked it at the bitch And I said Die computer die And he screamed with a sigh Then I said Yo you fuckin computer Youre giving me an electrical shock I only got half a brain left so what the fuck do you want me to do with it Go get a sock So I put it over my dick He said What the fuck are you talking about Put in a number shit So I taked it out on his computer screen And he fucked me up with a goddamn big step and gangsta lean I said Yo this shit aint funny no more The beats going off the The beats skipping and the only thing left to say is Put the beat back on the track so I can Bust a funky rhyme again Well the next thing I No no no noEmbed

Fuck You Lyrics Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg Snatched it off beat him over the fucking head with a peg Go to bed with the keg wake up with a mixed up with alka seltzer and formula D Fuck a acid tab I strap the whole sheet to my forehead Wait till it absorbed in then I fell to the floor dead No more saying case closed end of discussion Im blowing up like spontaneous human combustion Leavin you in the aftermath of Holocaust and traumas Across the the bombers we blowin up your house Killing your parents and coming back to get for mamas And Im as good as keeping a promise as Nostradamus I aint making no more threats Im doing drive bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets Im more or less sick in the head Maybe more Cause I smoked cracked today yesterday and the day before Saboteur walk the block with a Labrador Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador Foul style galore Verbal cow manure Comin together like an eyebrow on Al B Sure Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless Patrolling Corners Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth for a roll of quarters Im meaner in action than Roscoe Beating James Senior smacking his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in a wild hood was a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse And aint shit change I kept the same mind state since the rd time I failed th grade You prolly think that Im a negative person Dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death cause I fall down a cement flight of steps and land inside a bed of spider webs Throw cautions in the wind you and a friend can jump off a bridge and if you live do it again Shit why not Blow your brain out Im blowing mine out Fuck it You only live once you might as well die now I squat like a blunts tips something cavi Making green like Mitch Gift rap vocals dispatch With every attempt I had this game shook up When Dre cook up Every thug look up Chronic got me on chill Eyes bloodshot heavy built Lay a nigga out like quil Clear the guilt I rock Corollas from low riders to henny toasters Cut off dead weight to keep my formulas Kosher Accept no invitations Dre losing his stack Slimmest chances of Michael Jackson getting his black fans back My reputation is like a tech nine and I got the best in the circle Three minutes wreck time See the hand faster than the eye can chase it Dre b real soul assassins got potential buttons activated No illusion I have you caught up in a rapture Executive decisions from the mother fucking puppet masterEmbed

The Half Time Show Freestyle Lyrics The one man on the planet thatll drive off of the Grand Canyon Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes So fast itll look like an invisible man standing Im headed for hell Id rather be dead or in jail Bill Clinton hit this and you better inhale Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky Came home in a frenzy pushing a ten speed Screaming at Aunt Peg With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg Eff a headache give me a migraine damn it I like pain And you should be anywhere that a mic aint You rap knowing you wack You act up and Im throwing you down a flight of steps Then Im throwing you back up em If they dont like the track fuck em The rap struck em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck And then backed up on And any half assed known rapper that trespass Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly Im sicker than a Pac dedication to Biggie Im free falling feet first out of a damn tree To stampede your chest til you cant breathe And when Im down to my last breath Im a climb the Empire State Building Get to the last step and still have half left Pompous roll with monsters and dons for accomplices Cock non fiction concepts constant Bomb threat and I aint even on yet On spec I spit thunder and you aint even seen the storm yet Lightning in the clouds start a fight in the crowd Hyper and loud get this mic in your bowels biting my style Attack all of yall react on the thought of yall Slaughter yall Im calling yall in fact Im blackballing yall More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers Blame fame for it shrapnel bits tore the tissue Burying the under the gravel Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience My odyssey carries the compare me to Phoenix Solid and hard and light up a star I got to be Venus Huddle and bomb back take cover and all that And try to not die you not rugged enough You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game Im a bubble on contact like peroxide Im touching a cut You stuck in my raps Yall sucking my ass boosting my confidence a buck and a half I know the game Im a train trapped inside a name And whoever they taught me yo we ride the same I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame This is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds Hit you with six shots in mid air and four more on the way down As eight strays graze through a kids hair on the playground You lay down on a stretcher No pun intended just hop out of this whip And leave it unattended fore I whip out this gun and end it Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute Cause I can leave your Infinit full of those even if someones in it Snatch the airbag hit the corner and park it Corner the market I got her tied up in a chair and gagged Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged Like cavewomen while Im gravedigging with Marilyn Mans You get laced by the gun in case you try to run Hatred on my face by the ton get baked by the sun Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal Topping levels of combustion thats hot enough to stop the devil Innovative thrust that a enemy The impactll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees Black boy since birth burst and tore the womb up To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up Trust me Im the epitome you better bust me Anybody can say Eff and he gon touch me Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava Man and its hot Im out of my head From the bottom I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top Raw thats what I came out here for To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up Im fly against all laws of gravitation I done crushed all yall now you want a collaboration But eff that you stepped up so Im a eff your rep up And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up So stop violence or violencell stop you Got crews iller than anybody on your block do I roll with a white boy that pop shrooms Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you What a wonderful day I should go outside and play Aint no need to sit inside the house and hibernate Hi Ren e I was just about to toss a live grenade In your driveway and drive away Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS Blood dripping from it Ripping your stomach up from the waist up You talk a lot of ish but you was never ill though Im sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh Jumped up choked a giraffe snapped his neck and broke it in half Waging wars went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange And wiped my ass with his page in Source Demon is here Im steaming this year I rip Mystikals voice box out and scream in his ear Its not a gimmick trick its an image I live it Give a what I dont know what a what is to give it I grab your throat and squeeze it until its swollen Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it No more do I battle emcees for fun Now its guns and niggas should run from the Its barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism Through Israel and the art when even theyre dark and dismal Im a deranged breed shoot me Ill catch a bullet in my teeth And spit it right back at you at the same speed Ill injure if Im offending you we can go to blows Even my interview should be a Hip Hop Quotable You can have the title thats for brothers thats cocky Ill take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase Im rebelling your chains in fact you wack Im telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps Youre soft hearted Ill say Lets take it to the streets Youll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started Im a deranged breed so dont try to touch this I told you I dont know the chorus Forget a chorus my metaphors are so complicated It takes six minutes to get applause And by the time you all catch on Im a end your career And walk away with the floor so you have nothing to fall back on Ill throw you out of ten floors Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours Im indoors waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores To go outdoors and do some in stores This trick wanted to blow me I said It ought to happen You swallow nut girl No but I brought a napkin Getting skully while Im autographing Got my daughter laughing Cause I sent her mother white water rafting Im not a fact Im a proven fear Mr Rogers blocking my U Haul Screaming You aint moving here Lorena Bobbitt come here want a souvenir Ive been high as L since I was a

Green And Gold Lyrics What would it take to push a man Far enough to put somethin material over a human life What would drive someone completely over the edge To do some shit like that The green and gold I done filled my lungs up With so much of this crack smoke My necks bloated my techs loaded Im flat broke and Im pissed off Mad at the world Ive had it with girls And Im frustrated ran to the bus stop Just made it and hopped on Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on I spot John a white collar worker In clean cut walked up to him He was like what Whatchu mean what You know what time it is man At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen A man holdin a nine in his hand Shot him from the bottom up Stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck Hopped out to flee on my feet Fucked around forgot that I left my ID on the seat Your arrival want survival but is you fit Your arrival want survival but is you fit Im rising with the sun Synthesized with the universal Im goin to be a better man and this be my rehearsal For the future this your game Make a name to get the fame and the dame Forget the same as everybody who came Before its simple and plain You be a mere facsimile Fallen like Gallipoli Thinking yall from Italy But Im the goumba and Im working hard at my craft Great grandpa carried concrete up a shaft What did you laugh Huh Yeah you You think its funny raising kids Without no books without no money Ma got honey funny thing its that you think youre seeing me A mere reflection in the mirror here I come Im getting nearer Coming even closer can you feel a realer presence in your being We inside lyrical ride and I advise you now youre seeing A true seer never fear cause Im here in your midst forever Cleverly helping you better see yourself that be my gist Open fisted let my energy flow we good to go Its Able bodied Mr Zinn Vesuveo Survivor Soul Watch em fold hold the gold smoke the green gimme the gravy Give it up dont give a f like Slim Shady Between you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will lost getcha gold heaven hold getcha green Tween you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will die sold a soul for green and gold now say goodbye Should I ever live to fulfill this dream Would I ever k for the life of the team If I ever came between you and the green Whos the fiend By any necessary means I chase a dream thats deep like space To conquer then escape from this place without a trace But I await to face personal mercenaries Bounty hunters wanna check me for my nickel bags Ill be smoking til my eyes bleed red Meet me if you can then proceed ahead Reach for what you need now No time to think just move and react Who you gonna call when the wall is at your back Trying to blitzkrieg me for the sack Fiends better believe me sure as I breathe Their teams be getting touched back Rush me and I cut back the rumor that you only live once Lets put it to the test so we can live like legends Down to hold the line like Selaie Hold the seventh seal of heaven every time If a subtleties committed somebody fumbled the dime Winners guzzle the wine I smuggle mine with them But he who has the whole nine Will always double down and play for ten These are the rules adversaries stayin cool Shooting glances like pool While you dying for the change Im changing for the principle Mystical rebel soul in the physical Behold the gold but dont fold for the green Untold best unkept secret unseen A king should only tell his queen one thing The light sleeper is the keeper of the team But keep it between you and me Between you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will lost getcha gold heaven hold getcha green Tween you and me I can see in yo eyes Wise to the next stay in checkmate Getcha your Green getcha Gold It come between me and you Will die sold a soul for green and gold now say goodbye Should I ever live to fulfill this dream Would I ever k for the life of the team If I ever came between you and the green Whos the fiend By any necessary means Embed

Alright lets you took uhm Im talking of exhibit A The first thing from Benzino Di did you I mean did something happen to spark that between you and him did anything happen I mean Eminem Angie i swear on my daughters life I never met this dude I never met this man this girl in my life I never met this woman she is obsessed with me I can I cannot understand it you know what it is I think that I think Angie a lot of times being that Ive been out for like you know the last four years or whatever I think people are starting to forget a little bit that I came from the bottom Angie Softly Mhm right Eminem You know what Im saying I took those cards and I remember Denaun Kon Artist from D told me some deep shit the other day He said Remember when we was flipping burgers at Gilberts and you was mad you was always punching walls and breaking mirrors and saying I cant get a deal cause Im white cant get a deal Im white Im white its cause Im white its cause Im white And then I took the cards I was dealt in life and I flipped them I flipped the cards and now Im selling so many records because Im white you know what Im saying Angie Right Right Eminem So I flip the cards I was dealt but this dude is a fat year old shriveled up wrinkled prune with a big puffy big puffy clown hair So take them cards you were dealt with and say that in your rap flip them cards You know what Im saying Take them cards that youre dealt Stop being mad at me stop concentrating on my life so much and get one on your own Hot com the hottest hiphop spot on the web Angie Is it fair to say that you are not just from Benzino but just in general like youre just tired of hearing people beef about that Eminem Im sick of the excuses that everybody making excuses like if people must not listen to my songs like in White America like I clown about it You know what Im saying I but the truth of the matter is that I flip the card Angie I flip the card Everybody has a set of cards youre dealt with in life then flip them You got to take them cards and flip them If he doesnt have is smart to flip them cards dont blame me Dont blame me cause you suck This dude Angie I think could very well after hearing his last record I truly believe and Im not even exaggerating this dude could possibly be the worst rapper in the world Angie In your opinion Eminem In a lot of peoples opinion Well Im serious like Ive never Ive never thought I would see the day where I met or heard the whackest rapper in the world Ive heard a lot of whack rappers but he very well possibly could be the worst rapper in the world going against one of the best And thats not to say to toot my own horn I I I never would consider myself the best if anything Angie Do you do you not Eminem No Angie Cause some people would right now consider you right now the best out Eminem I would not consider myself best out Angie Who is Eminem You got Jay Z you got Nas you got Fifty All of them guys all of them cats Redman all of them guys are are the best at what they do and you know what Im saying I think a lot of times maybe it I dont know maybe it bugs some peoples mind a little bit that Im not only Im not only rapping but Im making the beats too now Im making the beats Im doing the producing you know what Im saying Angie At least youre getting a lot of money some people get tight about that man Eminem It not even Angie its not even about the money because I have yet to charge for a track Angie Really Eminem I did a track for Jay I didnt charge I did a track for Nas I did a track for Xzibit I dont even charge for the tracks Im free If I respect you as an artist and I like your shit Im gonna give you a track Im gonna give it to you Cause to me its not about the money its about hip hop Hot Hot Hot com Angie Eminem is still on the phone I have a million questions about the whole Cent thing but lets pick up where we left off before just for a second Eminem Going back to what we was talking about as far as just Angie If you just tuned in Eminem is on the phone Hes kinda talking about his side his perspective on this whole thing that happened with Benzino and Eminem You know I guess They say they say this when you when you hit forty that you go through your second childhood so I think that is what this man is going through Its the second childhood but I havent got there yet Angie Did you ever speak Have you ever spoken to him Eminem Ive never even spoke to this man you cant speak to him because he record conversations I might what if what if I call this man and I threaten him over the phone Angie How do you know that How do you know that Eminem Huh Angie How do you know that Eminem Because he took a tape He called Paul and was taping was taping Paul the whole time and Angie you know Paul Pauls not a fighter Its Pauls job to de escalate the situation so he took that screaming at Paul and put that on the beginning of his song Angie To someone in the studio You heard that thing Eminem Now this man is not talking to me hes talking to my manager its my managers job to de escalate the situation Im on probation Paul has seen before how Ive reacted to certain things and thought he was doing the right thing by trying to squash it This dude trying to play dirty pool Angie Wow Eminem What this dude is I think its a mid life crisis Angie hes going through a mid life crisis Hes done everything from Will Smith records to Rock The Party trying to come back to the streets Angie Is he really getting under your skin No I mean I cant I mean Eminem The only reason The only reason that I responded to this clown in the first place is because of the extortion that is going on between him and Dave Mays Nobody wanted to address it Everybody in the business you talk to any rapper in the business and Im not gonna put you on the blast Angie but we all know whats going on at The Source Ray Benzino has Dave Mays shook And you cant play two sides of the fence you cant be a rapper you cant be a rapper and own a magazine own half of a magazine Because then what happens is you call rappers that you like you call them and you want them to make a guest appearance on your album and if they dont want to do it because you suck Hes gonna then hes gonna shut you out of his magazine so you cant play both sides of the fence like that You just cant do it Angie So thats what motivated you to see Eminem Thats what motivated me Angie Was that something that was bothering you before he started getting at you Eminem You know what used to bother me its been its been the mic the mic rating system in The Source Like when I was a kid growing up in the early s on hip hop The Source as we used to know it was the bible of hip hop Like what it was their word was gold If somebody got a four mics you was going to cop it If somebody got five mics you was going to cop it If somebody got three and a half yeah you know you wouldnt know but their word was gold and it was usually right Now whats happened is this dude is doing the mic rating system he even said so in his song The five mic giver I give the mic I distribute the mics but Im a rapper too You cant do that Hes fucking the game up and like Angie I know that you have yet to receive a five mic review in The Source Is that something that has Eminem I have yet to receive even a four and a half Everybody gets a four everybody like thats the standard now thats the standard If you get a four and a half that must mean that Benzino wants you on his album you know what Im saying And as far as my contribution to hip hop him calling me a culture stealer and an invader and all that stuff As far as my contribution to hip hop How was my contribution to hip hop any different than Dave Mays and Jonathan Shecter when they started The Source twelve thirteen years ago was to make hip hop bigger and expand it If I can take hip hop and open more white peoples ears to hip hop so that artists like Nelly and Ja Rule and Jay Z and Cameron and Ludacris and Nas can sell more records then thats my contribution to hip hop You know what Im saying Angie Right Eminem Im just Im only Im only being real and I swear to you Angie this dude can can he can scrounge up change and call you from a payphone after this interview and he can can scream he can jump up and down and scream all he want he can make go in the studio and make a hundred thousand more records about me and base his whole life around mine I will not make another song about this man He cannot afford to pay the bill when I for the studio time Then he owes me back This dude is so whack I cant even get D to do a song about him Theyre screaming at me like why are you even giving this guy the energy Because unfortunately Im in a position where the more attention I pay to something the bigger it get Angie So how you gonna how you gonna how you gonna not now What if the dude just keeps making song after song after song and every now and then he say something that get on your nerves you just not responding anymore Eminem Im done Anything he does from from now on Eminem in muffled voice Will be like this Speaking from the grave I buried him I buried him I put the nail in the coffin I threw the dirt on the top of his grave I dont even think Ill put him in the coffin I think I just buried him in a hole and threw the dirt on his grave Angie What happens if you see this dude man Eminem What happens if I see him Angie Yeah Eminem Im on probation Im on probation so I really would not like to comment on that but I will let it be known that I got three months left of probation Angie Alright but you dont want to jeopardize any of this Eminem No Im not trying to yo Im trying yo Im trying to stay in the studio Im trying to release my records make my artists big

The Kids Lyrics Hey there little boys and girls Hey there little boys and girls Today were gonna to learn how to poison squirrels But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob Say hi Bob Bobs and still lives with his mom And he dont got a job Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot But his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock When its late and the lot gets dark And fake like he walks his dog drag em in the woods And go straight to the chopping blocks And even if they escaped and they got the cops The ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge Til one night Mrs Stacey went off the job When she felt someone grab her whole face And said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said Knock it off But Bob wouldnt knock it off Cause hes crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a doctor He grabbed Stace by the legs as chopped it off her And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander They never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana And what it might do to you So see if the squirrels want any its bad for you The kids the kids Dont forget about the kids the kids Shady what about the kids the kids The kids the kids Shady what about the kids the kids You gotta save the kids My penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it Fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut Speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels Ecstasy its the worst drug in the world If someone ever offers it to you dont do it Kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid And spinal fluid is final you wont get it back So dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back Meet Zach twenty one years old After hangin out with some friends At a frat party he gets bold And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it Suddenly he starts to convulse And his pulse goes into hyperdrive And his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb His back starts to look like the McDonalds Arches Hes on Donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin BLEH And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him H hey Adam Zach is a jackass look at him Cause they took it too so they think its funny So theyre laughing at basically nothing Except maybe wasting the money Meanwhile Zachs in a coma the action is over And his back and his shoulders Hunched up like hes practicin yoga And thats the story of Zach the ecstasy maniac So dont even feed that to squirrels class Cause its bad for you The kids the kids Shady what about the kids Dont forget about the kids the kids And last but not least one of the most humungous Problems among young people today is fungus It grows from cow manure They pick it out wipe it off bag it up And you put it put it put it put it put it Embed

course theyre gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade Theyve got the Discovery Channel dont they We aint nothin but mammals well some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote Women wave your pantyhose sing

candle and place it up on the mantel Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin Cause once youre hung from the drapes its

I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Cause I dont give a fuck if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Im a compulsive liar settin my preacher on fire Slashin your tires flyin down Fenkell and Meyers Plates expired soon as Im hired Im fired Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire Bitch didnt you read the flyer The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor No bitch Im retired Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron Im ripped Im on an acid trip My DJs in a coma for lettin the record skip Im fuckin anything when Im snortin Its gonna cost dollars to get my pitbull an abortion Some bitch asked for my autograph I called her a whore spit beer in her face and laughed I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam All bitches is hoes even my stinkin ass mom Ayo flashback two feets two deep up in that ass crack Weed laced with somethin nigga pass that In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats At a Stop the Violence rally I blast gats BMI on publishin get yo ass capped The Kuniva divide up yo cash stack Run yo motherfuckin pockets ASAP I dont need a platinum chain bitch I snatched Shaqs Born loser half thief and half black Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked And found chopped up in a trash bag So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Cause I dont give a fuck if you dont like my shit Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick Embed

One Handed Juggler Lyrics A new day is dawned upon us the grass is green Its time for the letter thirteen To make an entrance and put my foot forward And take a step forward now take the scene Thats fine the setup with your cold busted deaf rhymes Ive heard enough of that to last me a lifetime The fuse is lit now just stay clear from And prepare your eardrums to hear some fierce piercing An ear piercing sound Lyrics that are gruesome cause I determine the deuce Im coming with damage at the weakened ones who kicked them Lyrics so simple you could literally predict them Try to go a little bit fast with the jam keep it with the band making it even harder to handle So do not try to hang with the gang what you can do is hang with the senseless I am relentless sent to the click or two forces its not an easy chore But as soon as I got the mic just track the M M is talkin about the Nikes To gain speed guess Ill lead the new breed I speed the stampede to make a man bleed Im reckless unaffected when I wreck this Formed this but that enormous When I strike I feel angry total anguish But I fake where you panic then I vanish from his sight Cause think of us as blind knowledge is to realize Give it chance to stick into your skull and your real eyes The richer will never see me coming and thats a bet Next time youre getting stupid trying to be prepared Damn My dreams alive it give me something to strive for The fact that I drive good made me wanna drive more Reach the flip side I put aside the mom side Ha ta ta ta I walk on the wild side I stand in the jungle the jungle with both hands I swing on vines in the trees flyin Tarzan A lot of people say I dressed up and disappeared Cause that the fact that I say that somebody wish they were here But if Im making a point I make sure that its sounding good I dont just put words together that sound good Now Im tired I thought of which way I could say Ok this clean Leading on a single footprint in the sand Its amazing how fast the boy couldve become a man And I said I know man something as a donkey Just said like a honkey Huh uh no Do I need to prove this Most likely yes So lastly just do it before I can go One two three Taking it to the limit once again its a single dance in behind In a minute Im going a million miles and give it a punch line Making the mess of everybody and leaving them in the mist Imma be knocking out so fast that he be showing a clench So be thinking ready to give it a shot You better be set to give it every single ounce of energy that you got And now your holdin a mic forget time the rammers in the backseat And shut your damn mouth Beat going juggle the beat gone I cast you outEmbed
The Storm LyricsIt s the calm before the storm right here Wait how was I gonna start this off I forgot oh yeah That s an awfully hot coffee pot Should I drop it on Donald Trump Probably not But that s all I got til I come up with a solid plot Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk Imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan And say a prayer that every time Melania talks She gets a mou Ahh Imma stop But we better give Obama props Cause what we got in office now s a kamikaze That ll probably cause a nuclear holocaust And while the drama pops And he waits for shit to quiet down he ll just gas his plane up and fly around til the bombing stops Intensities heightened tensions ar risin Trump when it comes to giving a shit you re stingy as I am Exc pt when it comes to having the balls to go against me you hide em Cause you don t got the fucking nuts like an empty asylum Racism s the only thing he s fantastic for Cause that s how he gets his fucking rocks off and he s orange Yeah sick tan That s why he wants us to disband Cause he cannot withstand The fact we re not afraid of Trump Fuck walkin on egg shells I came to stomp That s why he keeps screamin Drain the swamp Cause he s in quicksand It s like we take a step forwards then backwards But this is his form of distraction Plus he gets an enormous reaction When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada All these horrible tragedies and he s bored and would rather Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers Then says he wants to lower our taxes Then who s gonna pay for his extravagant trips Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered Then does it more From his endorsement of Bannon Support for the Klansmen Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that s black And comes home from Iraq And is still told to go back to Africa Fork and a dagger in this racist year old grandpa Who keeps ignoring our past historical deplorable factors Now if you re a black athlete you re a spoiled little brat for Tryna use your platform or your stature To try to give those a voice who don t have one He says You re spittin in the face of vets who fought for us you bastards Unless you re a POW who s tortured and battered Cause to him you re zeros Cause he don t like his war heroes captured That s not disrespecting the military Fuck that This is for Colin ball up a fist And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch He s gonna get rid of all immigrants He s gonna build that thang up taller than this Well if he does build it I hope it s rock solid with bricks Cause like him in politics I m using all of his tricks Cause I m throwin that piece of shit against the wall til it sticks And any fan of mine who s a supporter of his I m drawing in the sand a line you re either for or against And if you can t decide who you like more and you re split On who you should stand beside I ll do it for you with this Fuck you The rest of America stand up We love our military and we love our country But we fuckin hate Trump Embed

Psychopath Killer Remix Lyrics Damn son whered you find this See the key to a kilo is to be low key bro Dont skeet on these streets bro TIME AND PLACE FOR THAT So be Loki bro And when youre ready to go skeet go Thor on your Whore like she dont want it no more Drop the Hammer cram her fuck that body slam her with no manners Like Bruce Banner but even madder Another one and done but the real fun with a stupid naked cunt comes from making her run And she weighs a ton And I sit back when Im done Click clack in my backpack son Cuz my wife for life is that heater Keep her when I need her Date her at the movie theater Like a James Holmes Repeater A James Holmes Repeater A James Holmes Repeater Fuck batman I wanna be like that man Got a call from my therapist went there stood on his chair and just Pissed in the air And said a prayer like Dear Lord Fuck a shrink I drink before I think and it all makes sense Otherwise Im thinkin without blinkin when Im on the fence Flipping the fucking Lincoln at my own expense Cuz Abes head is like mine AGAINST COMMENT SENSE So gimme a penny or some henny and Ill figure out the rest Amen Im a psychopath Im never keepin it plain Lyrical murder is somethin Ive been about Ever since I was a little kid doodlin in class Drew a picture of my teacher bullet in his head ruler in his ass With a toilet in front of him throwin up pissed off Prolly symbolic of this thought sick taught Until my inner enemy interrupts Im havin nightmares of leavin behind my dreams With anything less than a full bank Its like Im General Hong and Im standin in front of a gun Im puttin myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank The hood is over my eyes but the wool aint Yeah got the mentality of bein with a wizard Every award show we dont even get considered How do you sell somethin thats so lyrical To a kid who wouldnt know what was hittin if it hit him Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit Before me and Shady who was thinkin bout Detroit We put the world onto it so watch how you say fuck me You just might jinx yourself whoops your girl gon do it Cause I was in that in Chicago at the same time I had already been grindin since thats longevity And if you think youre lyrically better you better be a killer Oh yeah You aint ever seen a motherfucker get realer Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose Cause aint nobody iller no one nobody for realer This elite drinker is the ringleader Im a deep thinker Im a street preacher With a street sweeper full of heat seekers In your Jeep speakers Imma keep ringers I dont need heaters I got the meat cleaver Welcome to the slaughterhouse Niggas try to tell me I spell too much Capital S to the laugh to the T E R Ho U S E now go to hell you fucks word Making work disappear quick as magic Abracadabra the trafficker blacker than Africa Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood Money like Dracula has him a spatula ask me a question Am I the best with the flexing Fuck yes with the goon talk I just moonwalk all over the beat then Im lightin up the street CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller Oh yeah You aint ever seen a motherfucker get realer Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose Cause aint nobody iller no one nobody for realer Feelin it in the air breathe it in the night Staring at the full moon Did you ever think you would come to find Maybe in my dreams The thought of retiring Is makin me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and What up ma Im applyin for the rim job are you hirin Im hopin to fill up your openin Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements First I gotta accept youre in a lobby in Ireland And youve probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am in No mood to be playin second fiddle slob on this violin With no strings attached Im just the product of a hostile environment But bein brought up so wrought up inspired But I dont know why its still like Im caught up inside a whirlpool Not an appliance but applyin this science I psychotically rhyme And its like stars are aligned all in alliance Heart of a lion balls of Goliath Obscene talk intertwined like a beanstalk and a vine But I keep walkin the line between the wrong and the right But everything I write seems wrong and its like Im ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause In the fabric of our modern society Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans Dammit the Popes mad again Probably shouldnt have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin Singin Bagpipes from Baghdad again In my dads drag draggin a faggot in a GLAAD bag Wont be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again You thought I was lyin when I said I think that Im crossin the line again Ive lost my mind

the rhyme to end Like fuck em all Im just ridin Like I m locked up inside of a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car Uncle Ronnie was driving bout to burst in through the side door Of Arkham Asylum and park in

couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than whats goin on in your parents bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But cant but its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips And if Im lucky you might just give it a little kiss And thats the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is Of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade Theyve got the Discovery Channel dont they We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote Women wave your

One Handed Juggler Lyrics A new day is dawned upon us the grass is green Its time for the letter thirteen To make an entrance and put my foot forward And take a step forward now take the scene Thats fine the setup with your cold busted deaf rhymes Ive heard enough of that to last me a lifetime The fuse is lit now just stay clear from And prepare your eardrums to hear some fierce piercing An ear piercing sound Lyrics that are gruesome cause I determine the deuce Im coming with damage at the weakened ones who kicked them Lyrics so simple you could literally predict them Try to go a little bit fast with the jam keep it with the band making it even harder to handle So do not try to hang with the gang what you can do is hang with the senseless I am relentless sent to the click or two Then I start to forces its not an easy chore But as soon as I got the mic just track the M M is talkin about the Nikes To gain speed guess Ill lead the new breed I speed the stampede to make a man bleed Im reckless unaffected when I wreak this Formed this but that enormous When I strike I feel angry total anguish But I fake where you panic then I vanish from his sight Cause ignorance is blind knowledge is to realize Give it chance to stick into your skull and your real eyes The richer will never see me coming and thats a bet Next time youre getting stupid trying to be prepared My dreams alive it give me something to strive for The fact that I drive good made me wanna drive more Reach the flip side I put aside the mom side Ha ta ta ta I walk on the wild side I stand in the jungle the jungle with both hands I swing on vines in the trees flyin Tarzan A lot of people say I just up and disappeared Cause that the fact that I say that somebody wish they were here But if Im making a point I make sure that its sounding good I dont just put words together that sound good Now Im tired I thought of which way I could say Ok this clean Leaving not a single footprint in the sand Its amazing how fast the boy couldve become a man And I said I know man something as a donkey Just said like a honkey Huh uh no Do I need to prove this Most likely yes So lastly just do it before I can go One two three Taking it to the limit once again its a single dance in behind In a minute Im going a million miles and give it a punch line Making the mess of everybody and leaving them in the mist Imma be knocking out so fast that he be showing a clench So be thinking ready to give it a shot You better be set to give it every single ounce of energy that you got And now your holdin a mic forget time the rammers in the backseat And shut your damn mouth Beat going juggle the beat gone I cast you outEmbed

Eminem Freestyle Lyrics I got a riddle Whats little and talks big with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle That will do anything to throw dirt on my name If it means walking the whole Mediterranean Is he an Albanian Armenian Iranian Tasmanian No His names Raymond and oh oh sorry yo so sorry woah But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe Rapping in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it before so Either accept it or you dont and lets move on If Ive shown that Ive grown and get the bone Keep licking these nuts you industry mutts Keep walking around sniffing each others butts Or should I say asses What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses The question I ask is how can I explain this How can I swing this in English language If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain Am I being real or am I being fake Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine Or am I caught up in this hot water Wody on my daughter I told ya I love this culture dont let em insult ya Ima tell ya one more gain this is the environment that I was brought up in But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration Or should I say shun Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism Your face is numb youre stunned your look is cold Like that of a man of seventy some years old And it only gets colder which Is why I understand And cant be mad at a forty four year old fan With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown Papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down In his new chair that goes round and round That he bought from new money in his bank account That I get him every issue when the thang comes out Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out And let his black sidearm wrestle his white side Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide He might find someone dumb enough who might ride But aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black There is no slack Far heart for college grad in a fitted hat and a hunch back Standing by the clearance coat rack In some old slacks and tomorrows old throwbacks Yeah Shady in the place to be seen And it takes what I got to rock the mic right Still not gonna cater these punks Fucking cocksucking pussy lips haters dicks cunts Embed

Unsigned Hype Eminem LyricsWow its been a few months since weve profiled a creme de la creme MC in need of some nurturing from a record company During our ninety day hiatus however our ever reliable Flavortracker came across a target that in many ways redefines the term ill He goes by the name of Eminem After making a buzz in the Detroit area for quite some time he just recently gained the hip hop nations attention with his impressive showing in events like the Rap Olympics One glimpse of the contents within his Slim Shady demo one cant help but recognize that this rapper of the Caucasian persuasions got skills As far as flow he keeps it simple yet extremely effective In Murder Murder he kicks a humorous tale about a bank heist gone wrong Left the keys in the van With a gat in each hand Went up in Eastland Shot a policeman Fuck a peace plan If citizen bystands The shit is my hands Heres your life span For what your lifes worth this money is twice than Grab a couple grand and live in Iceland See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan Another guaranteed rewinder is the semi demented Just The Two Of Us a crazy tale about the actions Eminem takes upon his babys mother With wifey placed comfortably in the back of his trunk Em drives far and wide explaining to his seed the reasons why daddy had to bury mommy Point blank this aint your average cat This Motor City kid is a one of a kind talent and hes about to blow past the competition leaving many melted microphones in the dust Embed
Mile Lyrics Sometimes I just feel like quittin I still might Why do I put up this fight Why do I still write Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics And show these people what my level of skills like But Im still white sometimes I just hate life Somethin aint right hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like Da duh duh da da it aint my fault Great big eyeballs my insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just cant do it my whole manhoods Just been stripped I have just been victd So I must then get off the bus then split Man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this Mile Road Im a man Ima make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin Sorry Momma Im grown I must travel alone Aint gon follow no footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape from this Mile RoadEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics Look if you had one shot or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already Moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes choking how Everybodys joking now The clocks run out times up over blaow Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody You better go capture this moment and hope it dont You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring but superstardoms Close to post mortem it only grows harder Homie grows hotter he blows its all over These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada and so the soap opera Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner But the beat goes on da da dom da dom You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime No more games Ima change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I cant get by with my nine to Five and I cant provide the right type of life for my family Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life And these times are so hard its gettin even harder Tryna feed and water my seed plus teeter totter Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot another day of monotonys Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not Mom I love you but this trailers got To go I cannot grow old in Salems Lot So here I go its my shot feet fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime And you can do anything you put your mind to Everyone give it up for Louden Swain Embed

Rap God Lyrics Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But Im only going to get this one chance Somethings wrong I can feel it Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot so call me Rap bot But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my gen s I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I half cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Mad a livin and a killin off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his wuusack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables skill a holic This flippity dippity hippity hip hop You dont really wanna get into a pissin match With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that Ill still be able to break a motherfuppin table Over the back of a couple of feggats and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad Its actually disastrously bad for the wack While Im masterfully constructing this masterpi ce Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintainin this shhh aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz Pac N W A Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position To meet Run D M C induct them Into the motherfufkin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You tas think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and tell me what in the are you thinkin Little gay lookin boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy Youre witnessin a mass occur Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy Oy vey that boys guay thats all they say lookin boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy Ima work for everything I have never asked nobody for sh Get outta my face lookin boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloadin Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin But I got your mom deep threenoh Im out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin To censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP when I Tried to say Ill take seven kws from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AS Ferty Sewvn a revolver and a See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from though And I dont know what the fww that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fufkin cornrows You write normal uck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fwag at Mayweathers pad Singin to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was a special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfufkin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too Ugh school flunky pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongue in cheek fufk you Im drunk so Satan take the f wheel Ima sleep in the front seat Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But uck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fauwk am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him

Rolling Stone Q A Exclusive LyricsAre you feeling good about the album at this point Um thats a tough question man For the most part yeah But I dont know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out With every record that I put out someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music I just hear flaws in it Like I hear Oh fuck I could have done this better or that better And Ill work it to death Obviously if I wasnt comfortable with it I wouldnt put it out But from the beginning ever since my career started I dont know if Ive ever been totally like this is completely it In this last crunch what have you been working on I guess you would say last minute jitters of Fuck Are the vocals loud enough Can you hear what Im saying on this part Is the beat right Are the vocals too loud If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out I would do that Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it But youre not changing lyrics or anything like that Its just all mix and sound stuff Its just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part because when I decide to keep a song thats pretty much it Like if it doesnt work I pretty much know right away right when I get it in the car and take it home Rolling Stones Review of Eminems The Marshall Mathers LP So why did you dye your hair blonde again Um Ill say that one was idea In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be he hit me with the idea and I was like Yo you know I thought about that right And he was like Well you know why not And I was like I dont know how its gonna look I havent had it in how many fucking years Five six years I was like Im so used to it being dark you know So I just tried it And I was like Fuck it Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording Not really honestly Because I already had most of the songs And I dont know if Im gonna keep it like this or how long Im gonna keep it But for right now it is what it is And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff You recorded songs or something or at least you had beats So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around I feel like right now Im probably working harder than Ive ever worked in my life And Ive probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show which is a little hazy cause just so much shit was going on at that time Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the Mile movie and the soundtrack and the score to the movie This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly Thats crazy Once I had the direction that I wanted to go and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations Like I wouldnt want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that So a lot of recording A lot of songs that people probably will never hear We hit a couple of road blocks There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and youre like Fuck man I feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture A lot of people maybe even you think the original is your best album Its probably my favorite I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons Hate to even say that about my own record but I mean the first three records I think they may have captured a time period And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said you know Encore and Relapse wasnt it was just a different time Youve been hard on Relapse but Tyler the Creator says that its his favorite hip hop record in years He loves that record Yeah he tells me that every time I see him I dont hate the record I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs And you know I dont know if I necessarily found that balance yet because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like Ha ha this is funny You know walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and youre laughing about it Because when I got sober it was like Ive said this before but it just was like Oh shit I can think straight again So I dont know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs writing songs that felt like something that brought some kind of emotion I ran accents into the ground I got stuck on that kind of serial killer crazy vibe and just kind of went with it On Recovery obviously the world came to you on that one How do you feel now about that record I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show Like creatively and songwriting I guess I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp Aside from working with Dre it was like I always wanted to produce my own records because producing is fun to me too One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them Its kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody elses hook and kind of interpret the words Because my own hooks I already know what I mean when I write them The way that I do music is like regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can So regardless if the beat feels like Wow maybe this could be played on the radio Im not like Maybe radio would play this so Ill just wing it Like I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs aspect So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP How did you decide to make your life miserable like that Well heres what it is Its not necessarily a sequel Okay As much as it is a revisitation like this is a different time period in my life So theres not gonna be like continuations of every song or anything like that To me its more about the vibe and the nostalgia One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that You know retro shit and try to make it current like bring it up to date So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction You were like Why dont I go back to the source Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like Fuck man Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more On Recovery I wanted to focus more on writing and not have to worry abut making the beats On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre So I kind of started producing again a little bit I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I dont know if thats what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like Yo just let me finish this up and lets go see him Youve called Rick Yoda was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career Learning I did Um yeah I mean the best part about Ricks vibe is hes very Zen like in the sense of just Let it happen The weird thing about it is nine times out we would know instantly if something didnt work and it didnt feel right you know Hes almost like a coach Hes very psychological right Yeah the guys got his shoes off Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere Hes not afraid to try anything I kind of felt in the same way I felt and still feel to this day as far as like wanting to impress Dre We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time Id get together with him wed start adding shit to it The dudes got so many ideas man One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches When he fucking scratches some shit its almost like this perfect slop that it has on it Not that its off time or anything like that but its just like its fucking weird I dont even know how to explain it You just know that he scratched it I dont know if that even makes sense or not Its like a simple scratch like a basic kind of thing but its so fucking dope when you hear it Its just its vintage him And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio Oh hes got some shit in the stash Yeah Definitely So much has changed in hip hop since you started producing did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff Um not necessarily because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right Obviously I pay attention to whats going on and whats out and keep my finger on that pulse But I dont ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing Thats no offense to anyone else Basically if there are outside influences that are current you let that come in from the other producers but your shit is your shit Yeah Thats exactly it More current sounding shit I leave to them And not that I dont feel like my shit sounds current but its not the exact same thing And I think Ive updated as well On the new song Legacy youre talking about yourself in detail as a kid What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said He aint shit or bullied or whatever It felt like one of them self empowerment songs Everybody I believe wants to show the world that One day Im gonna be this One day Im gonna be that Everybody has goals aspirations or whatever and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them Like if you havent been kicked or whatever if you never went through Tribulations Tribulations and shit like that then youre perfect and fuck you anyways So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted Like You dont matter Oh yeah Im gonna show you So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy into what I leave behind when Im gone And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me Theres many many songs that got me through a lot of shit I just love that you rhyme Onyx with comics on that song I dont know if anyone will get this like this is super nerdy but the rhyming words in that song never change And thats just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed Youve praised the Beastie Boys evolution but it doesnt seem like youre going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment I mean listen my sense of humor has certainly not gone away I realize that Im an adult a grown ass man and I dont know what Ill be doing a year from now years from now but I dont think that my tongue in cheekness will ever go away I guess its just a part of my personality I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject I dont want to make a whole album of that of being a downer I dont want to make a whole album of being too uppity You gotta try and find that right balance and thats one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting In other words recording till I get it And if I record fucking songs and I dont have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work then Im gonna keep going and keep recording Youve written a bunch of your own hooks and even sing some of them Where does your sense of melody come from Thats a good question I would want to say that its stemming from early hip hop Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies at least on the shit that I grew up on I dont know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is I can only hum something But I think it just comes from all the data that Ive collected in my years of listening to music And you know fuck man I think that as hip hop started evolving there was more melody in it people were starting to sing hooks Even like early Slick Rick Hey young world those kind of things Maybe I took it somewhere different at times I dont know Maybe its just pure instinct Honestly thats probably what it is I dont want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just dont know where I get that sense from you know what Im saying Im not a singer singer I just know whats in key and whats not Having Kendrick Lamar on your album did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that hes in the same camp that hes on Aftermath only made sense to me He came to Detroit we kicked it for a few minutes you know and I felt the vibe of what hes like and everything and you know hes a super cool and super humble dude When we did that record I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to Control Is there advice you would give him at this point I dont know if he needs advice He seems like hes got a really good head on his shoulders man Hes very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one Hes like a hip hop head man he just loves hip hop And obviously the way that he did the Control verse it was almost like if you get mad at him then you might look foolish He set it up so that you cant really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking Or you should be thinking Fundamentally do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour day by day with me That whole Rap God record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek So I mean do I want to feel like that Maybe sometimes Again it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best Again thats why Kendricks verse worked so well because he only said what every rappers already thinking If you dont want to be the best then why are you rapping Read more http

A Day Without A Rhyme Lyrics A day without a rhyme Without a strong rhyme to step to Without a strong rhyme to step to Without a strong rhyme to step to Step into my world let the lyrics lead the way Its a place of escape that deviates from the everyday A resort of a sort its for your mind though So you relax them acts and me I let the rhyme flow So you can follow it chew it before you swallow it The lyric is a delicate thing you shouldnt holler it And yell it its give your lyrics your all But remember one thing a weak rhyme could be your downfall Take it from me cause Im a hip hop authority Poetry redemption is our number one priority A day without a rhyme is like a day without sunshine How can you unwind without a funky drum line I cant see it let the Ken Wood kick Why Cause rhyming is my game and the mic is like a joystick I never lose my lyrics sting like a hornet I get ready for help this for the town before the storm hits Without a strong rhyme to step to Perform is eternal and in my lifetime I hope I never have to see a day without a rhyme Legendary the lyrical olympian Merciless and cruel I rule cause Im the champion Defending my position like a heavyweight fighter A dope rap writer deadly as a poisonous spider Yeah no comparison the women seem mysterious My lyrics work as servants leaving listeners delirious Under my hypnosis on the edge of their seat Its like a science fiction movie with groovy hip hop beats So just relax and youll enjoy the double feature Let my vocals take control of your soul then let the rolling reach you You cant ignore the dance floor anymore The rhymes are mind blowing for the fancy and the hardcore Hip hop lovers who pump it as a past time The furthest sent from their mind a day without a rhyme A day without a rhyme Without a strong rhyme to step to A day without a rhyme Without a strong rhyme to step to Floating atop a growing sea of MCs Liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease Thats right I flick lives like boogers from my fingers My assassin has my back smoking dope just like a gunslinger Im just a merciless dog you know the time Id rather die than go a day without a rhyme You see a lyric is a poets personal emotion A pocket full of holes he throws a deep devotion is stretching keeps the roof constantly running My craftiness and cunning makes the floor so stunning Its as dumb as it can be theres not an MC who can hang with me They like to battle but they never wanna bang with me Cause Im a real dirty and dogmatic In fact Im just a dope rhyme fanatic I like to rock the party every time I get a chance to But on a day without a rhyme what would you dance to but no its nothing like this The drums are death and my DJ has a crisp twist Larger than life dear mayor of the new school Flushing rappers out like a motherfucking whirlpool Bloodthirsty a witch and a boy yeah The MC destroy your boy what can I do for you You dont want me youll never survive Youll be eaten alive the very second you are mine So do yourself a favour save your breath And take a step to me and youll step into the arms of death And quite frankly that will be a real slither I rarely use the is it time to feel the flipper boy This my rhymes are clicking like clockwork I need a Grammy so Im a piece of chalk work entertaining you I kick fiction But dont be alarmed if you hear a contradiction that Whos to say what the future might bring By the grace of Allah Ill just continue doing my thing Creeping the math and then that constant movement But do say lyrics that can stand no improvement so Yo if you were sleeping or napping or waking You know who you are I guess youre just breathtaking I write the rhyme to strike you like a lightning bolt With every finishing stroke another rap is smoke So Im the Deej this year the microphone musketeer This is the year of the merciless Ameer theres no lying in my dialogue Cause when I go out Im going like a raw dog Well this was fun I hate to break but I gotta run My homies landing on my box with the See you next time but in the meantime Try not to go even a single day without a rhyme W Without a strong rhyme to step to Without a strong rhyme to step to Without a strong rhyme to step to W Without a strong rhyme to step to A day without a rhyme Yeah dog that was dopeEmbed

It aint considered a crime unless they catch you We all die one day Niggas when I step up in a bar faggots wanna look Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook Like Imma stand here as a man and Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand I got issues got no time Got guns that mourn niggas moms Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas vibes Everybody running for their motherfucking lives Tough club niggas we leave early cock back surely Open up your fade your gray brain meets Motor City pave Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z O is an animal skirts get murked Dont ever let a nigga tell you slugs dont hurt Dont ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard Trust in God cause yous about to get catch a bullet scar I give a fuck where you from who you be with Keep this a secret right by the nuts A thatll light niggas up and this high make me not give a fuck Niggas know what Im about out here I dont toot my own horn cause I dont have to You could run your mouth I dont

finish they last set They say you live by the gun you die by the next nigga gun If thats the case then get a bigger one You dont think I pack the pump cause Im out the hood Thats a stereotype like

chemical in my membrane Im Slim Sha D and the D is for deez nuts And you can get each one for free so feast up Ill pee in a cup for three months Im having an E party for Easter please come Cause we

You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest I got a twelve gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle Im the strongest around you know how I get down I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy And turn it off before it end cause the bad guy die If you trying to buy guns Im the nigga to look to So what they got bodies on them They still look new You can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something When I raise my knife shit Im fitting to cut something They say I walk like Ron ONeal and talk like Goldie If the bitch think I love her the bitch dont know me Hahaha sorry Kim Niggas know what Im about out here I dont toot my own horn cause

Hamilton Mashup Lyrics Look I am not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot Hey yo Im just like my country Im young scrappy and hungry And Im not throwing away my shot His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting Im a diamond in the rough a shiny piece of coal Tryin to reach my goal My power of speech unimpeachable Only nineteen but my mind is older These New York City streets get colder I shoulder Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he Better go capture this moment and hope it Enter me Dont be shocked when your histry book mentions me I will lay down my life if it sets us free Eventually youll see my ascendancy Well its the taking of the Pelham If you want a doody rhyme then come see me Ive got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin I keep it on and on its never quitting time and His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring but superstardoms Close to post mortem it only grows harder Homie grows hotter he blows its all over These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada and so the soap opera Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner But the beat goes on da da dom da dom dah dah dah dah You better Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop Well you cant you wont and you dont stop You only get One hint honey You sure did put on a show Yes yes you had to be a big shot On your ass and bust your eardrums Listen everybody cause Im shifting gears Im with you but the situation is fraught Youve got to be carefully taught If you talk youre gonna get shot Im that kid in the corner All fd up and I wanna so Im gonna Take a piece of the pie why not Im not quittin Think Im a change up my style just to I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper Oh am I talkin too loud Sometimes I get over excited shoot off at the mouth I never had a group of friends before I promise that Ill make yall proud Lets get this guy in front of a crowd And these times are so hard and its gettin even harder Tryna feed and water my seed plus teeter totter Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot another day of monotonys Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not Mom I love you but this trailers got

when I get my specs And Get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Top notch is my stock on the soapbox Ive got more rhymes than Ive got gray hairs You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow Ive got a hole in my head and theres no one to fix it I gotta straighten my thoughts Im thinking too much sick shit Everyone just takes and takes takes takes takes Ill have to step back I gotta contemplate Well Im like Lee Perry Im very I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory Whens it gonna get me In my sleep Seven feet ahead of me If I see it comin do I run or do I let it be Is it like a beat without a melody See I never thought Id live past twenty Where I come from some get half as many Ask anybody why we livin fast and we laugh reach for a flask We have to make this moment last thats plenty Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop Well you cant you wont and you dont stop MCA come and rock the sure shot If you had one shot and one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip MCA come and rock the sure shot I know the action in the street is excitin But Jesus between all the bleedin n fightin Ive been readin n writin We need to handle our financial situation Are we a nation of states Whats the state of our nation Im past patiently waitin Im passionately smashin every expectation Every actions an act of creation Im laughin in the face of casualties and sorrow For the first time Im thinkin past tomorrow You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let

Lose Your En as LyricsNowadays the mankind is watching astonished the extraordinary and unusual worldwide fact that moves daily as in a giant billiard table enormous ciphers flying around as bits and bytes at the speed of the light transferring from one point to another of the planet fabulous fortunes in a true speculative orgy completely dissociated from reality without any correspondence with reality of our physical world the so called globalization It seems to those not fully aware in which I include here sadly the great majority of citizens that this process is creating a world in which everyone will have access to a higher standard of life with greater social justice That fact comes to us by the media as a cure all for the biggest world problems As a matter of fact it s necessary to be pointed out that only of all those transactions raising to trillion dollars a day only to percent refer to commercial and industrial activities On the other hand the great majority of financial transactions is purely speculative as if money by itself would be able to generate more money That s a fantasy that is carrying the world economy to a dire end Until the s the Bretton Woods rules were followed Money to flow between nations needed a previous government authorization There was a fixed exchange rate between the currencies of the greatest industrialized nations The FED assured with gold equivalent any transaction In other words there were restrictions to the flow of speculative money In the US government imposed an unilateral rupture and the barriers disappeared Gold reserves are no longer necessary Money is no more the wealth symbol it is the wealth proper A fiction in such a way that it goes to the edge of insanity is supported by a group of worldwide institutions the so called international financial system And here I include the IMF the World Bank the World Trade Organization and so on That is the money empire The false money The real speculation conducting the mankind to its ruin and destruction Well gentlemen it is with that false money that mega speculators through the world are willing to buy real riches of all developing countries In Brazil they are selling out by the dozen all of our strategic state companies The right words are these they are giving away all of our strategic resources including Vale do Rio Doce company the greatest iron mining company in the world by only three billion dollars equivalent to less than half of one percent of its estimated value In Brazil we have the greatest reserves in the world of niobium titanium first quality quartz We are the greatest gold producers in Latin America We have the richest sub soil in this planet and we are seeing our riches going there cheap to the industrialized countries President Clinton during the Summit of the Americas in Santiago recently said Your prosperity lifts ours our prosperity lifts yours Is that really true From the Brazilian states of Amap and the Minas Gerais we have carried millions of tons of manganese sold by insignificant prices Now in those Brazilian states we have only big land craters holes and our manganese rests in Pennsylvania It is now part of the US strategic inventory In the future we ll have to pay whatever price they want for that same mineral Let me call your attention to another fact we are naturally the richest country in the world for while in at least one state of the US it is necessary the desalinization of water for having fresh water we have of the fresh water sources in the planet We are the fifth country in territorial extension We receive solar energy all year long all over the country That huge and inconceivable amount of energy is partially stored on the bonds of atoms and molecules of the carbohydrates and the lipids in the plants from where we extract alcohol and oils that can substitute petroleum allowing Brazilian energy independence We don t have aggressions We don t have earthquakes We don t have hurricanes and the like Nevertheless two thirds of our population live in an unacceptable condition Half of them live in absolute poverty in absolute misery Brazilian government pays to the international creditors and their Brazilian representatives about half of the gross national income that s to say five billion dollars a month only as interest The internal and external debts altogether represent today the astronomic cipher of a half trillion dollars Government maintains a fiction of currency stability concealing the disorderly growth in public debt and promoting the destruction of all the industrial production chain of the country with mass importation of industrialized products and even food Our party PRONA rises against that process Is imperative a new Bretton Woods But as we don t have the condition to impose such an agreement on the international scenario and as we do have in our country all that we need for our survival there is only one option not to drown We ll break with the international financial system We ll no longer accept this speculator s extortion We ll sit down for negotiations impose our sovereignty We ll price our goods with justice The interest rates that we ll pay shall be the lowest possible That is the only way to proclaim our economic independence Thank you very muchEmbed

attacking Im ringing in speakers and when Ima rapping and chopping your minds bout to blow And Im stepping in and I may serving up syllable karate several syllables will be now severed through time and Im chopping it up as Im coming and making incredible flow And Im thinking of breaking em off when Im taking a breath Then I be rhyming opposing your wrath Ima now coming and rhyming in wonderful timing aint leaving that path Ready for whatever and if you run up youll suffer then with aftermath Because Ill bring you the torment when I be feeling that moment better believe in this omen cause when Im coming Ima just bringing you all the death Ima now Crucified Ill be riding around the atmosphere imma sting em with that pitiful venom Aint nobody got the wrath and then I put em in a bag amd ne baking em quicker Hacking and backing and packing fuck it Im saying to come and get em my venom Better be coming and breaking all of you have you ever seen em Im sicker and wickeder planning on picking the scene up gotta be hearing that breaking up anybody topping the clip and Im bringing the chopper I gotta be the one to come on perimeter get up I hit em Im coming to heat it a syllable when I blow up you better get up if I call get ready for the war Ive seen all the war I sit in it warm Im sending a body but nobody want ever to come and to get it I feel em I heat em I eat em up I lost everybody not giving up I might be crucified like the criminals nobody wanna call it and give it up I take it they be watching Tonedeff Up in the morning I feel the immediate beat of my heart that is speeding up Feeding a demon that s seeking to eat at my being I get up to pee and I think of a million things that I need to achieve And the chi is depleting I m sinking while dreaming of singing I m brushing my teeth and Im seeing the bleeding My vigorous scrubbing is leaving the gums till they re bloody and beaten My stomach is screaming for something appealing to munch in the PM But what I ve been dealing with really been keeping my hunger receding I want to proceed but I m weak and wiggin the fuck out I m freaking I m stuck in a rut and the wheels of my brain MistaSL Coming to getem hitem with my venom then ima be chopping them all into pieces Chopping a body cause im a killer so I do it with minimal reasons Rippingem up to illest chopper when I get up on the track Bout to be banging them all when I am ready to attack Then im tearing your body down to a molecular scale When the cops find your body it will already be pale Dumping the guts over the side into the bay over the rail Chopping off your head and send it to your parents through the mail Spitting so many bars they re swarming you like a monsoon Ending so many people at this point I think that Mizury Mize Packing semen of a demon being a heathen beating seeds in any region making a legion while Im reading it like Ima rapping yakkin Charles Manson While I be given a reason for you to believe in Im a beast beasting it every season teething and feasting feeding Off beats like Im treating myself for my own personal satisfaction Acting up acting out with the action with tactics putting tax on the verses im no freestyler my style isnt free febreezing it fresh with the way that I be serving up the motherfuking murder When working overtime being a hard worker performing that lyrical serial killer horror Halloween when Im on the scene making it reality Optimiz Prime sort of like a Transformer While packing a quarter of dab like a disorder dabbing upon these motherfuckers swerve When I hit them with the words merged in a verse converted in a sweet entree serving dessert first Chopper tongue twisting it with a curve gassing them till it burns Im that Chopper they warned you about to ask around about me to get to chopping properly and when you ready to pay attention and stay steady and learn BoneZ Im outta North Dakota sick of freezing on the the corner so I took it down to Florida and I hoped you didnt notice But the money was important we were gonna take it over but were troubled and were broken I could see the devil hoping that wed fall apart and break it down Im never gonna take an L I really gotta make it now or take a bow and fade it out A better way to say it than I really kinda hate it now Failed the tox report the fuck yall talkin bout Double time a minute and I keep up with the speed of light a mothafucka thinkin that hes better SplytSecond Got em reading off of the lyrics it s difficult to follow When I m blazing down the interstate a foot upon the throttle When I splatter the wall with the haemeoglobin and show it off to the public is how I m modeling a mottle better get a bigger bottle To be able to stomach when I decapitate at the capital leaving em captivated To get a payment or be vindicated for debacles Gripping a pair of the triggers I m finna be ripping and tearing the ligaments Quickly then it gotta be Domo arigato Mr Roboto Yall better calm down you in need of Tai Chi Thinking you could ever rip into a Mac Lethal She looks so thick and juicy give it to me in the booty shorts Then you gotta get up in the morn and get out Lets speed it up big breath Never been a counterfeit of nothing I am just an elevated Entity I m coming and giving it back and then pumping Dump on every instrument with increments of sentiments And syllables I lunge I m livid again I m sticking it in their muffins Make a couple million I m hoping to I m going to So gimme another reason I should sit around and not experience Benefits of getting down when all the drivel that they re spitting Is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness The Jackal Planetary Choppers and Ill break it like a bottle Taking off it in my shuttle other rappers better scuttle Cause Im pulling the throttle imma rock it in my rocket It better watch it like a pocket and Im better than you sock it in the jaw Man Im spitting raw and Im bout to mawl The Jackals vicious dawg imma hopping like a frog Im the rapper with it all chop ya like a log and down you fall HA Representing AUS and I feel a little lost Im years old and Im chopping with the gods How did I get here Did someone lose a bet Yeh Honourary member from S B R Yes we are the Planetary Choppers stuffing you in lockers cause we bullies on the mic Interchopper Callin me a chopper but dont know why beast Maybe cuz when choppin Im blazin the beat Some ofem thinkin Im weird whatever they mean Why the fuck they be hatin me Choppin through steel Ill be bendin the beat when I run and then turn into brain sick hitem with the same kit Getem and be beatinem in the middle of my verse Killin while chillin is muthafukin worth Whateveer Im touching Im murdering during the UC Dont you think Im venomous Turn down youre lame as fuck Coming around with a caution ya finna get out of my rushin Im sick of these niggas being suckin while they trynna rap fast like an UNDAGROUND CHOPPER Dont compare with speed Deny covering it Interchopper Im nailing it with Inter Speed Just cam up with delivering unbelievable complexity Choppin is like velocity fater it gets harder it hits Speedin up with a nitrogen just like I

Freestyle Lyrics Happy year anniversary Shade Its like this and like that and like this Im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners Lookin for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters Im meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Senior And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse And aint shit changed I kept the same mind state Since the third time that I failed ninth grade You probably think that Im a negative person Dont be so sure of it I dont promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death As I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind You and a friend can jump off of a bridge And if you live do it again Shit why not Blow your brain out Im blowin mine out Fuck it you only live once you might as well die now Met a retarded kid name Greg with a wooden leg Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg Go to bed with the keg wake up with a Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula D Fuck an acid tab I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead Waited til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead No more said case closed end of discussion Im blowin up like spontaneous human combustion Leavin you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas Cross the bombers we blowin up your house Killin your parents and comin back to get your foster mommas And Im as good at keepin a promise as Nostradamus Cause I aint makin no more threats Im doin drive bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets Im more or less sick in the head maybe more Cause I smoked crack today yesterday and the day before Saboteur walk the block with a Labrador Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador Foul style galore verbal cow manure Comin together like an eyebrow on Al B Sure Embed

Superbowl XLV Commercial Lyrics I gotta question for ya What does this city know about luxury huh What does a town thats been to hell and back know about the finer things in life Well Ill tell ya More than most You see its the hottest fires that make the hardest steel Add hard work and conviction And the know how that runs generations deep in every one of us Thats who we are Thats our story Now its probably not the one youve been reading in the papers The one being written by folks whove never even been here and Dont know what were capable of Because when it comes to luxury Its as much about where its from as who its for Now were from America But this isnt New York City Or the Windy City Or Sin City And were certainly no ones Emerald City This is the Motor City and this is what we do Embed

White America Lyrics America Ha ha ha We love you How many people are proud to be citizens Of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars For the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold or so were told I never wouldve dreamed in a million years Id see So many frickin people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs Its like a kcufing army marchin in back of me So many lives I touched so much anger aimed In no particular direction just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days Who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair With some peroxide reachin for a t shirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me I aint causin nothin but problems And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government Im lovin it I shoveled dirt on my life and now Im dumpin it on White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself If they were brown Shadyd lose Shady sits on the shelf But Shadys cute Shady knew Shadys dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby Look at my sales Lets do the math If I was black I wouldve sold half I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap so forget school Im too cool to go back Give me the mic Show me where in the world the studios at When I was underground no one gave a flying craps I was white No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like Im done with it until I met Dre the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his zass Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got Was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got Like dang we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids Who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist Whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss Til I created so much mother turbulence Straight out the tube right into your livin rooms I came And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope Waitin to choke tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this like I dont like this note All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy Sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early Surely hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now Im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a chick or say toggaf shoot Just look at me like Im your closest pal The poster child the mothertruckin spokesman now for White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my lip I go to TRL look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America I am the Derringer Aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the the house of represenitives and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy FACK you Ms Cheney FACK you Tipper Gore FACK you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have FACK you Ha ha ha Im just playin America You know I love youEmbed

Don t Do Drugs Lyrics Dont do drugs drugs are bad Dont smoke weed remember kids Dont do drugs drugs are bad Dont smoke crack say no to drugs Woke up in the room spinning Two fat women beside me dressed in black linen No teeth and grinning Empty bottles and ecstasy on the night stand Who wants to have sex with me Lets see a show of hands Imagine if all rap sounded like this only songs with a message about smacking a bitch Or maybe a song about snorting lines and getting lit Maybe I could burn it to a disc and sell it to the kids I think I was born just to fuck with your head a white rapper who only raps about snorting coke and getting head My mom gave me som rope and said to tie it around my neck I sp nt the rest of the day just hanging around in the shed up in the lab cutting lines and getting high Cant decide if I want to listen to Cent or Obie Trice Dont make any sudden moves cause I have Dre tied up in the back And if you do Ill fuck around and write a sequel to fack Dont do drugs drugs are bad Dont smoke wee remember kids Dont do drugs drugs are bad Dont smoke crack say no to drugs Dont do drugs drugs are bad Dont smoke weed remember kids Dont do drugs drugs are bad You see its so easy just say no to drugs Hi there Susan Did you know that adults dump out half or their soda and then mix booze in Or better yet they do it while driving their car Its really dangerous but how else are they suppose to get home from the bar And how about the pills your mom calls candy locked in the cabinet Havent you ever wondered Dont you want to try it You already know where she keeps the key Just wait until shes had a couple and falls asleep Remember theres no reason to tell your dad Well theres no telling how many hes had You see your dad has a problem that we call addiction It blurs his vision and he ends up making bad decisions Quiet theres a knock at the door Its your father more drunk than before Well I guess thats my cue to bail your moms passed out And your dad is looking for some tail good luck Susan Embed

Slick execution from music s perennial delinquent LyricsEminem has become the first rapper to perform a headline show at Wembley Stadium I see a lot of people who appear to be fucking wasted how many people here are fucking wasted And how many people are here are just fucked up mentally calls Eminem introducing My Name Is the anthem of every angry adolescent on the planet Its met with a feral roar from his army of fans adorned in a uniform of Parental Advisory T shirts foam middle fingers or V For Vendetta masks You can see why this crowd of largely febrile young men welcome him back to the stage like an army of internet trolls blessed by the presence of their maker Eminem is the first rapper to headline Wembley Stadium and yet by his own admission hes only here because Hyde Park deemed his lyrical content too offensive For musics perennial delinquent now aged tonight is the first of two shows at the capacity venue and is the first time the Detroit artist has played the city since a set that was then threatened by gay and womens rights protesters before the rapper sparked further controversy with the performance itself as he took the stage replete with chainsaw Friday the th hockey mask and perhaps the most cardinal sin of all wearing nothing but a pair of loosely fitting denim dungarees This time however the goal is to establish himself as one of musics most iconic artists rather than shock the masses In those years Eminem has encountered all manner of wrinkle inducing incidents family lawsuits overdoses and subsequent stints in rehabilitation and now sobriety but he still cuts a striking figure His arms are big but his face is thin and remains hidden by a black cap throughout the show with his bleached blond hair barely visible He rattles through the first half of the set as if reacquainting himself with the stage and its not until he brings on surprise guest Dr Dre halfway through the show for Next Episode Still Dre G Thang and Forgot About Dre that Eminems ambitions become fully realised even if Dres voice is a much more almighty force than his apprentices Despite his budget stretching to snag the richest rapper of all time unfortunately there was no sign of Dido for Stan tonight her part as an ill fated pregnant girlfriend instead played by a glamorous backing vocalist in a leotard Some of Eminems vision is executed brilliantly after all hes been making stadium rap albums since Tracks like Survival befit its location with its poodle perm guitars and the Beastie Boys indebted Berzerk sounds incredible live Sing for the Moment and Toy Soldiers are huge crowd pleasers but then they were always built for arenas to fill them maybe but not necessarily satisfy When it works Eminems music fills the space with a dark rumbling magic The Way I Am and his medley of My Name Is Real Slim Shady and Without Me hits the balance of huge and yet intimately evil but the flat points during the show come from a lack of menace of spite that same sinisterness that first gained him his loyal tribe and made him so exciting This article was amended on July to correct a song title from Sing It to Sing for the Moment Embed

Rap God Lyrics Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But Im only going to get this one chance Somethings wrong I can feel it Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot so call me Rap bot But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my gen s I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I half cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Mad a livin and a killin off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables skill a holic This flippity dippity hippity hip hop You dont really wanna get into a pissin match With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad Its actually disastrously bad for the wack While Im masterfully constructing this masterpi ce Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz Pac N W A Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position To meet Run D M C induct them Into the motherfuckin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin Little gay lookin boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy Youre witnessin a mass occur Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say lookin boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy Ima work for everything I have never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face lookin boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloadin Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin But I got your mom deep throatin Im out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin To censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP when I Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK a revolver and a See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from though And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows You write normal Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad Singin to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was a special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too Ugh school flunky pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongue in cheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Ima sleep in the front seat Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a god Woah you can be a god You can be a god a god oh Woah you can be a god You can be a god a god ohEmbed

Eminem Arose Lyrics Se potessi riavvolgere il tempo come un nastro Dentro uno stereo un giorno per ogni pillola o Percocet che ho ingoiato Ridurre il Valium avrei sentito ogni cosa Ma la morte sta diventando cos concreta aspetta Mi hanno collegato a delle macchine Ti voglio bene Bean non volevo tu sapessi che ero in difficolt Mi sento come se fossi sott acqua sommerso come un sottomarino Ho appena sentito un infermiere dire che il mio fegato e i miei reni non stanno funzionando Sto seducendo la morte un donnaiolo immagino Sia un arrivederci lo stesso infermiere l ho appena sentito dire che mi stanno staccando la spina Ed il tuo compleanno Jade mi sto perdendo il tuo compleanno Piccola mi dispiace cazzo odio quando sei ferita Hai E bimbe grazie per aver aspettato ad aprire i regali Ma piccole potete aprirli Pap non riuscir a tornare a casa per Natale Vorrei avere la forza per mandarvi un bacio Cerco di stringere il pugno ma non ci riesco sono congelato Strillo ma non esce nessun suono sto piangendo dentro grido Le mie corde vocali non me lo permettono urlo ma non a voce alta Tu metti le braccia attorno a tua madre per calmarla wow Ho appena pensato alla navata lungo la quale non riuscir mai ad accompagnarvi Non vi vedr mai diplomarvi con il tocco e la toga quasi il com possibile che stia accadendo adesso Ho cos tante altre cose da fare E Proof mi dispiace tanto di averti deluso ma questo mi ha spaccato in due Il pensiero che non ci sar pi un me e te Tu mi hai regalato delle scarpe Nike come nuove per andare a scuola Doody ci sto provando ma tu tu eri il collante che ci legava Cos tante cose il tempo darei qualsiasi cosa per riavvolgerlo Ho dovuto attraversare i corridoi ed esser costantemente ricordato Dalle fotografie sulle mie pareti e non riuscivo a dormire la notte a causa di Quell immagine impressa nella mia mente di te su quel tavolo Ed io che cado sul tuo corpo incapace di alzarmi per salvarti Dio perch te lo sei preso Sto cercando di tenere in vita la sua eredit ma sto morendo dov Nathan Ragazze siate coraggiose prendetevi cura di vostra madre Fate dei bei sorrisi per le foto rispettatevi sempre l un l altra Vi amer per sempre e sar nel retro della vostra memoria E so che non mi dimenticherete mai Ma non siate tristi ricordandomi E fratellino continua a rendermi orgoglioso E faresti meglio a sposare quella ragazza perch ti fedele E quando vi starete scambiando quelle sacre promesse Sappi che se avessi potuto esserci ci sarei stato E se mai diventerai genitore so che sarai bravo Oh ho quasi dimenticato di fare qualcosa devo ringraziare anche mio padre In realt ho imparato molto da te Mi hai insegnato cosa non devo fare E mamma vorrei aver avuto la possibilit Di avere un ultima chiacchierata a cuore aperto con te Doody ti vedo sto camminando verso di te E riesco a sentire la mia anima lasciare il mio corpo e fluttuare attraverso la stanza Gli infermieri si chinano sul letto tolgono i tubi Poi il lenzuolo sopra la mia testa chiudono la stanza Bambine per favore non vi agitate Le vedo quelle guance bagnate Mentre mi stringete il collo cos insistentemente non volete lasciarmi Andare il cuscino inzuppato emotivamente distrutto Con ogni secondo ognuno pi vicino alla morte Ma improvvisamente sento il mio cuore iniziare a battere pi lentamente Poi un respiro le macchine iniziano a fare Devo aver indovinato i trucchi per imbrogliare sta roba Sto provando a riavvolgere il tempo come un nastro A trovare una scappatoia sto puntando dritto provo a svegliarmi Da questo sogno ho bisogno di ritrovare la mia forza interiore Per ricordarmi anche se dovr percorrere una ripida salita Per riscrivere un errore sto riavvolgendo il nastro Far uscire quest ultimo album e poi ho chiuso con tutto questo Ho finito al cento per cento Ne ho abbastanza mi sto ritirando fanculo Scusa limprecazione piccola ma sappi solo Che sono una brava persona anche se mi descrivono come un insensibile E se le cose dovessero peggiorare ma scommetto che non sar cos Prometto di buttare questo metadone nel gabinetto Stracciare queste vecchie lettere che ho scritto Tutto quel vecchio patetico disprezzo i titoli di coda si possono ritirare Sono fiero di essere tornato Sto per come in una rivincita sorpassare Relapse Con Recovery Mathers LP Mi aiutano a spingere fino al giro trionfale Dando gas verso di loro e superando il passato Considera gli ultimi quattro minuti come La canzone che avrei cantato alle mie figlie Se fossi arrivato in ospedale meno di due ore dopo ma l ho combattuto E sono tornato su di loro come un boomerang Ora sta nascendo un nuovo giorno Mi sveglio Marted mattina adesso lo so Embed
The Story So Far LyricsLike Lemme take it back to the year that most of this started Grew up in Barnet North London where my heart is Man wanna know why Im heartless Grew up in the worst way couldn t have cake on my birthday Yeah we couldnt afford the simplest things we all can rap The difference is I work so hard Cah I need to blow I know pressure I know pain I know real life struggle been living it everyday And ask me bout the time I nearly died in a car crash Outside my primary school when I was just age And the doctors said that I wouldnt ever make it but I Came back from the jaws of death Spoke to god who said I m born to reach greatness See my dad had to duck from the feds cah the poor guy couldnt get his visa One day they came home they took him Then they put him in jail and then they wouldnt let him meet us It was around this time that we found out my grandad was ill Got a phone call straight from my uncle Saying he was dying and I was wishing he was lying but he wasnt See my grandad was living abroad we couldnt afford to all go see him Been a fucked up ting but we couldnt all meet him We had to send dad luckily they freed him But the funny ting is that his freedom was a waste Cah he got there but he got there too late See my grandad passed away the previous day Then my dad came back and he kept his freedom But he didnt have much and he worked so hard and made sure we were eating So we started saving everything was going okay Over the years we saved bags then thieves broken in and it all got taken Mans heartless like Ansem And I know what its like when you have nobody wanting to help But you wanna get the grands up Man changed when my Nan got cancer Cah I watched her go through the chemo what I mean bro is a brand new me I seen the mad tings that my Nan had to go through Had opps like she was a gangster True say real talk and honestly I ve seen death like so many times that it no longer scares me Working way too hard so I couldn t give a fuck if a gyal wanna air me Cah me I dont chase no girls cah the last one left and left my broken Left my wounds open wishing you the best you left my heart frozen And I had to learn how to deal with demons Niyaz Asheeq Trinity that s bros Helped when I was low Helped when I was broke Any ting thats mine is yours when I blow And shouts out to Patrick Soj as well My day s in this music business Dont watch me just mind your own business Anybody step in to my wayll be a victim Come on then blud come on then try me Dont brag cos your watch says ice g You wanna know what cold looks like You can step in to my shoes take a look into my eyes g Right now man are savage with the grind Lost some friends that said they would have my back till the end of time We don t even speak no more I hope youre doing fine One day Im gonna make it And one day I might get why all this pain had to come my way for me to be famous Tell mum dont worry bout the bailiffs Ive seen real life stress thank God now Im feeling bless I dont mean to be heartless But these days man I got to use heart lessEmbed

Eminem Revival ALBUM REVIEW Lyrics Hey everyone Fresh Orange here the Internets busiest music nerd and its time for a review of the new Eminem album Revival Wow Wow This albums bad Its its really bad Like I dont want to waste your time I dont want to waste any more of my time It is bad I feel like this record has already sucked away enough of my life force so lets not beat around the bush Legendary Detroit rapper comes back r leases a sequ l to some of his most disliked albums Relapse and Recovery In a way this album is kind of like a meditation on his waning relevance at least thats how he sets the tone on the opening track here featuring Beyonc where he pens kind of like a lyrical odyssey on his fall from grace The bare piano instrumental in the background was a nice touch Beyonc s hook on the track is very pretty I find Eminems story and introspective lyricism on the track pretty compelling despite this weird erratic angry staccato flow that he seems to be locked into lately He sounds like a malfunctioning tone deaf robot who is like finding out what feelings are for the first time So he writes this huge emotional track about his fame his feelings on his fame his alleged perfectionism and then immediately after this he spends the rest of the album delivering onto us cuts that pretty much exemplify why hes not taken as seriously as he used to be To kind of take it track by track we have the barely tolerable I Believe and Chloraseptic The former of the two there is kind of an extension of the opening track but a bit more aggressive Both songs feature these very subtle kind of muddy trap beats Phresher whos featured on the song Chloraseptic is the albums lone rapper featured but he doesnt actually rap he just handles the hook You hear him occasionally on there but then he just kind of disappears and falls into the background as Eminem is delivering these triplet flows on the chorus Its kind of just like a really weird mix its one of many weird mixes across this entire album Like how he has sold millions and millions of records and his songs are mixed like garbage I dont know After this we have the song Untouchable which could essentially be the centerpiece to a Hamilton style rap musical inspired by white guilt I get the sentiment behind the track I get what Eminem is trying to communicate on the song but I feel like his approach is just so grossly preachy and reductive Not to mention his yelpy vocals and the instrumental are absolutely hideous and annoying Way to go ruining a completely good Cheech and Chong song Eminem is right in this song though because sometimes it can be really embarrassing to be white this moment is certainly one of them Blacks and whites sometimes mix But Black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks So Imma say it like this Dont date a Black girl take it as a diss The song River featuring Ed Sheeran is of course a terrible melodramatic rap ballad the worst bar on this track being Actually just shit on my last chick Because she has what my ex lacks Ex lacks Get it Ex Lax Musically the song just sounds really clich really trite overly dramatic The lyrics are all about being in a relationship built on lies and taking advantage of one another Its pretty unlikable no reason to listen to this track ever again The song Remind Me ruins another perfectly good song Joan Jetts I Love Rock and Roll Its this really garish ugly rap rock fusion the worst bar on it being Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea Yeah its just stomach churning its sickening I cant stand it The song Like Home is this anti Trump anthem that is trying way too hard way too hard to be meaningful and anthemic and inspiring Like I wish that Eminem had just recorded an acapella of his BET freestyle and just put it on here because some of the bars on this thing are like so corny in comparison to his performance there And the overblown kick drums and the glossy MIDI pianos in the mix do not help Worst bar on this track has to be Cause this type of pickle were ins hard to deal As in as in like deal like dill Like a dill pickle Also on this track he rhymes Nazi with not see and General Lee with generally On the song Bad Husband I dont know whats worse Is it the instrumental and the X Ambassadors hook the weird sputtering electronics in the beat or is it Eminems lyrics about How can I be such a garbage abusive spouse but such an amazing dad Which I mean I get it some people are terrible at some things good at other things its not really rocket science It just seems like a really weird kind of humble brag You know now that I think about it its definitely the X Ambassadors hook Thats grosser Thats the grossest part Even with Eminems final verse on the track trying its best to evenly distribute the blame across both parties Really desperately The song Tragic Endings literally sounds like a demo The mix sounds like crap It sounds like a demo song Why is it on this album I think this song just goes to show that all the money in the world cannot buy good taste It apparently cannot buy good production either The song Framed is one of the better sounding tracks on the record Lyrically its a pretty funny song Eminem comes through with this very zany expressive flow Kind of feels like old Eminem Theres a bit of a serial killer vibe coming through in the lyrics too Its kind of fun However I think Em sort of botches the hook on this thing like he did his marriage I was fraaaaaamed He got nothing to do with meeeeeeee We have more excruciating melodrama on the song Nowhere Fast Its pretty much your typical Eminem tugging at your heartstrings affair but with Kehlani on the hook Uh theres really nothing special about the track outside of Eminems vocal passages at the mark which is some of the worst vocal layering Ive heard all year It sounds like Eminem trying to harmonize with MIDI strings and a tone deaf robot Who knows what the future for us could hold Another shooter Uh oh The song Heat is this really stomach churning country rap It sounds like Eminem took every terrible quality of a Yelawolf song and tried to condense them down into one song The hook kind of makes me laugh maybe not in a way that Eminem intended but I guess thats an upside And there are numerous contenders on this thing for the worst bar uh Girl youre just going to have to put them other chumps on the back burner You got buns I got Aspergers I just bodied the beat so that hole must have been dug Cause it just died like food coloring does So lets get turnt like a shish kabob Twist it ma like an air conditioning knob On the song Offended I am offended but maybe not in the way Eminem intended me to be offended because theres nothing really all that edgy about the song you know Its just kind of childish thats all And there are actually some decent bars on this thing I like that line about someone not being able to catch a body if somebody fainted or that other line saying that his competition cant see him because he doesnt own a mirror which I think inadvertently is kind of a statement about Eminem digging himself so far down into a hole of mediocrity that hes literally lost all touch with the outside world and hes the only person who he who he can can talk to No really I mean with this track Im just kind of offended that I wasnt offended that much The most annoying thing about the cut is the moment where Eminem breaks it down into like a playground rhyme where he says everybody is going to eat his turds For the most part this is just zany off the wall Eminem you know You have lines about Bill Cosby facializing an interracial blowup doll of Rachel Dolezal There are moments in the song I think are kind of funny pretty entertaining but it does not make up for every awful track Ive had to sit through thus far The song Need Me featuring P nk is really like a P nk song featuring Eminem She takes up a bulk of the track which maybe is a saving grace if you like P nk and you dont want to hear so much Eminem any more on this album The song In Your Head completely ruins a wonderful Cranberries song one of my favorite Cranberries songs one of the best songs of the s totally wrecks it What is with this album and the lazy sampling Most of the time it just sounds like when there is a sample on the album Eminem is just rapping over a badly mixed and muddy cut of the song itself and just leaving it like that with some extra drums pumped in just to give it some punch I mean for the majority of the song Arose Eminem is just rapping over like this very faint sound of somebody singing the Leann Rimes song Some Say Love Maybe its a sample of the original track I couldnt quite tell it was super quiet and something about the sound of the vocals sounded a little off and weird The song Castle is one of the few tracks on the record I legitimately enjoy The female singer on the track is quite nice her vocal melody is very eerie and alluring the instrumental is decent too Eminem is rapping from a very heartfelt place about his daughter about to be born Theres this really strong sense of emotion and nostalgia and time passing on this cut There are moments where the storytelling and the narrative power of the track like almost approaches like Stan levels of amazing Theres a moment where the tone of the track almost starts to take that of a letter Eminem takes some pills and then its like hes dead essentially Which brings us into the next track the final track Arose where Eminem pulls off a pretty heart wrenching performance where it seems like he scares himself into having to say all these things to his family and his loved ones that he wishes he would be able to if he did in fact die Its a pretty moving moment although he does occasionally sabotage it with some very corny puns Eminem is on his deathbed on this track and hes still writing bars like theres a bunch of dudes in the emergency room going Ohhhh Ohhhh Whoaaaa Ahhhh So theres a point in the track when he sort of rewinds and sort of goes back in time to where he doesnt take those pills doesnt put himself on his deathbed The beat of the previous track reintroduces itself and he ends the album flushing the pills down the toilet which is actually kind of fitting for this album to end with the sound of a toilet flushing Yeah this thing is awful Light Tran sition Have you given this album a listen Did you love it Did you hate it Did you love it Or did you hate it What would you rate it Youre the best youre the best What should I review next Hit the like if you like

Lose Yourself Acapella LyricsLook If you had One shot Or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted In one moment Would you capture it Or just let it slip Yo His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now The clocks run out times up over blaow Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity Ope there goes Rabbit he choked Hes so mad but he wont give up that easy No He wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes It dont matter hes dope he knows that but hes broke Hes so stagnant he knows when he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him You better lose yourself in the music the moment You own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music the moment You own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking Make me king as we move toward a New World Order A normal life is borin but super stardoms close to post mortem It only grows harder only grows hotter He blows its all over these hoes is all on him Coast to coast shows hes known as the Globetrotter Lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product They moved on to the next schmo who flows he nose dove and sold nada So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose its old partna but the beat goes on Da da dum da dum da da You better lose yourself in the music the moment You own it you better never let it go You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetimeEmbed

Love the Way You Lie Lyrics Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I cant tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight High off her love drunk from her hate Its like Im huffin paint and I love her the mor I suffer I suffocate And right befor Im about to drown she resuscitates me She fuckin hates me and I love it Wait Where you going Im leaving you No you aint Come back Were runnin right back here we go again Its so insane cause when its goin good its goin great Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed I snapped Whos that dude I dont even know his name I laid hands on her Ill never stoop so low again I guess I dont know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em Got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get em Now youre gettin fuckin sick of lookin at em You swore youd never hit em never do nothin to hurt em Now youre in each others face Spewin venom in your words when you spit em You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em Throw em down pin em So lost in the moments when youre in em Its the rage that took over it controls you both So they say youre best to go your separate ways Guess that they dont know ya Cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over Its a different day sound like broken records playin over But you promised her next time youll show restraint You dont get another chance life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess thats why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things did things that we didnt mean Then we fall back into the same patterns same routine But your tempers just as bad as mine is youre the same as me When it comes to love youre just as blinded baby please Come back it wasnt you baby it was me Maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems Maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the drywall Next time There wont be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar If she ever tries to fuckin leave again Ima tie her To the bed and set this house on fire just gonna Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie On the first page of our story The future seemed so bright Then this thing turned out so evil I dont know why Im still surprised Even angels have their wicked schemes And you take that to new extremes But youll always be my hero Even though youve lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie oh I love the way you lie Now theres gravel in our voices Glass is shattered from the fight In this tug of war youll always win Even when Im right Cause you feed me fables from your head With violent words and empty threats And its sick that all these battles Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well thats alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie oh I love the way you lie oh So maybe Im a masochist I try to run but I dont wanna ever leave Til the walls are going up In smoke with all our memories Its morning you wake a sunray hits your face Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction Hush baby speak softly tell me youre awfully sorry That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me Run out the room and Ill follow you like a lost puppy Baby without you Im nothing Im so lost hug me Then tell me how ugly I am but that youll always love me Then after that shove me in the aftermath of the Destructive path that were on two psychopaths but we Know that no matter how many knives we put in each others backs That well have each others backs cause were that lucky Together we move mountains lets not make mountains out of molehills You hit me twice yeah but whos counting I may have hit you three times Im starting to lose count But together well live forever we found the youth fountain Our love is crazy were nuts but I refused counseling This house is too huge if you move out Ill burn all two thousand Square feet of it to the ground aint shit you can do about it Cause with you Im in my fucking mind without you Im out it Just gonna stand there and watch

Mockingbird English Version LyricsYeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey what daddy always tell you Straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about You got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad When Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry Cause youre scared I aint there Daddys with you in your prayers No more crying wipe them t ars daddys here no more nightmar s We gon pull together through it we gon do it Laney uncles crazy aint he Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it Were all we got in this world When it spins when it swirls When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusin you Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me But things have gotten so bad between us I dont see us ever being together Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby dont you cry everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya daddys here to hold ya through the night I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why we fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy pretty baby but I promise mommas gon be alright Its funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree And said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom Was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of Mile on Novara And thats when daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr Dre and flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the TV And momma didnt like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now Im sittin in this empty house Just reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here I like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it Shh mommas only gone for the moment Now hush little baby dont you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya Daddys here to hold ya through the night I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy pretty baby But I promise mommas gon be alright And if you ask me too daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird Imma give you the world Imma buy a diamond ring for you imma sing for you Ill do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine Imma break that birdies neck Id go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every karat dont fuck with dad Embed
